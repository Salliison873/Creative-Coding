I haven't eaten all day, how am I gonna do this, man?
Yeah, don't wait for her, man, don't wait for her
I'll tell you what, man, come with me now
And you know I'll get you some lunch, I'll hook you up with something
I got a little bank, you know, no problem
I hear you, that's cool
Alright, it's cool
Man, can't you guys just wait here about a half hour, man?
Yo, I'll be back man, I'm just gonna munch up a little bit man, I'm pretty hungry
Yo, later we'll come back, you know</p><br>

Here you will find food for your body
As well as comfort for your troubled mind
I'd really like some soup
Of course my friend, what happened to your hand?
Oh, nothing
Oh, food at last
How did they get here?
Regular storage procedure, the same as the other food
What other food?
Fish
(Food)
Protein
Now what happened
Well, the cop got <span class="blam">*BLAM*</span>
Next morning, I went to the store to get some food
(Bread and butter)
They arrested me
I'll save you, thank you
Would you like a snack?
Thanks for the drink
Chicken, beef or turkey
Operation Doomsday complete
All units report casualty, damage testing</p><br>

<p style="font-size: 25px; color:forestgreen;">Dr. Doom Skit</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px"><strong class="enough">Enough,</strong> you talk of the people's rights.
The people have only those rights which I choose to give them
And that's for their own good, believe me.
I do, DOOM.
They disappoint me, they must work faster!
But the prisoner!
Ah yes, the young traitor who has tried to turn my people against me
Watch him, I have special plans for that one</p><br>

<p style="font-size: 25px"> MF DOOM (Verse 1): </p>
<p style="font-size:20px">Beef rap could lead to gettin' teeth capped
Or even a wreath for mom dukes on some grief crap
I suggest you change your diet
It can lead to high blood pressure if you fry it
Or even a stroke, heart attack, heart disease
It ain't no startin' back once arteries start to squeeze
Take the easy way out, phony
Until then, they know they wouldn't be talkin' that baloney in the bullpen
So disgusting, pardon self as I discuss this
They talk a wealth of shit, and they ain't never seen the justice
Bust this like a cold milk from out the toilet
Two batteries some Brillo and some foil, he'll boil it
<span style="color:black; opacity: 100%" class="PC">He be better off on PC glued
And it's a feud, so don't be in no TV mood
Every week it's mystery meat, seaweed stewed</span></p><br>

<p style="font-size:20px"><span class="mask" style="font-size: 20px;">He wears a mask just to cover the raw flesh
A rather ugly brother with flows that's gorgeous</div></span>
Drop-dead joints, hit the whips like bird shit
They need it like a hole in they head or a third tit
Her bra smell, his card say, oh hell
Barred from all bars and kicked out the Carvel
Keep a cooker where the jar fell
And keep a cheap hooker that's off the hook like Ma Bell
Top bleeding, maybe fellow took the loaded rod gears
Stop feeding babies colored, sugar-coated lard squares
The odd pair swears and God fears
Even when it's rotten, we've gotten through the hard years
I wrote this note around New Year's
Off a couple of shots and a few beers, but who cares
Enough about me, it's about the beats
Not about the streets and who food he about to eat
A rhyming cannibal who's dressed to kill, it's cynical
Whether is it animal, vegetable or mineral
It's a miracle how he get so lyrical
And proceed to move the crowd like a old n**** spiritual
For a mil' do a commercial for Mello Yello
Tell 'em devil's hell, no, sell y'all own Jello
We hollow krills, she swallow pills
He follow flea collar, three dollar bills
And squeal for halal veal, if y'all appeal
Dig the real, it's how the big ballers deal
Twirl a L after every meal (food)</p><br>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">MF DOOM (Verse 3):</p>
<p><span class="what">What</span><span class="up"> up?</span>
To all rappers, shut up with your shuttin' up
And keep your shirt on, at least a button up
Yuck, is they rhymers or strippin' males?
Outta work jerks since they shut down Chippendales
They chippin' nails, DOOM, chippin' scales
Let alone the pre-orders that's counted off shippin' sales
This one goes out to all my people skippin' bail
Dippin' jail, whippin' tail and sippin' ale
Light the doobie 'til it glow like a ruby
After which they couldn't find the villain like Scooby
He's in the lab on some old Buddha Monk shit
Overproof drunk shit, who'd have thunk it?
Punk, try and ask why ours be better
Could be the iron mask or the Cosby sweater
Yes you, who's screwed by the dude on the CD, nude
</p><br>
Wait, bring him to me

<h2> Funky Crime - Red Hot Chili Peppers</h2>

cause funk is my attitude

funky crime funky crime
don't you know funk's colors blind
well I've committed a funky crime

Barriers of race
in the media take place

for what you do, don't budge
there's no groove to your gloom
who made you the judge
always room for funky tunes
and yes I funk it up
Funky boy

cause the funk is crazy<br><br>
Why do you do what you do

funky crime funky crime
don't you know funk's colors blind

Funky crime

<h2> Paint It Black - The Rolling Stones</h2>
<p>
I see a red door
And I want it painted black
No colors anymore
I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by
Dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head
Until my darkness goes<br><br>
I see a line of cars
And they're all painted black
With flowers and my love
Both never to come back
I've seen people turn their heads
And quickly look away<br><br>
Like a newborn baby
It just happens everyday
I look inside myself
And see my heart is black
I see my red door
I must have it painted black<br><br>
Maybe then, I'll fade away
And not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up
When your whole world is black
No more will my green sea
Go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing
Happening to you<br><br>
If I look hard enough
Into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me
Before the morning comes
I see a red door
And I want it painted black
No colors anymore
I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by
Dressed in their summer clothes<br><br>
I have to turn my head
Until my darkness goes
I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as night
Black as coal
I wanna see the sun
Blotted out from the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted
Painted black, yeah
</p>
<h2> Children Of The Grave - Black Sabbath</h2>
<p>
Revolution in their minds, the children start to march
Against the world in which they have to live<br><br>
And all the hate that's in their hearts
They're tired of being pushed around
And told just what to do<br><br>
They'll fight the world until they've won
And love comes flowing through, yeah
Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today
Will the sun rise up tomorrow bring in peace in any way?<br><br>
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear? Yeah<br><br>
So, you children of the world
Listen to what I say
If you want a better place to live in<br><br>
Spread the word today
Show the world that love is still alive, you must be brave
Or you children of today are children of the grave, yeah
</p>
<h2> Holy Wars...The Punishment Due - Megadeth</h2>
<p>
Brother will kill brother, spilling blood across the land
Killing for religion, something I don't understand<br><br>
Fools like me who cross the sea and come to foreign lands
Ask the sheep for their beliefs, "Do you kill on God's command?"<br><br>
A country that's divided, surely will not stand
My past erased, no more disgrace, no foolish naïve stand<br><br>
The end is near, it's crystal clear, part of the master plan
Don't look now to Israel, it might be your homeland<br><br>
Holy wars
Upon my podium as the "know-it-all" scholar
Down in my seat of judgement, gavel's bang, uphold the law
Up on my soapbox, a leader out to change the world<br><br>
Down in my pulpit as the "holier-than-thou-could-be-messenger" of God
Wage the war on organized crime<br><br>
Sneak attacks, rappel down the rocks behind the lines
Some people risk to employ me, some people live to destroy me
Either way they die, they die<br><br>
They killed my wife and my baby, with hopes to enslave me
First mistake, last mistake<br><br>
Paid by the alliance to slay all the giants
Next mistake, no more mistakes<br><br>
Fill the cracks in with judicial granite
Because I don't say it, don't mean I ain't thinking it
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away<br><br>
I know what I said, now I must scream of the overdose
And the lack of mercy killings
Mercy killings, mercy killings, killings, killings, killings
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away
</p>

<h2> Ya Got Trouble - The Music Man </h2>
<p>
A pool table, don't you understand?
Friend, either you're closing your eyes to a situation you do not wish to acknowledge
Or you are not aware of the caliber of disaster
Indicated by the presence of a pool table in your community
Well, ya got trouble my friend
Right here I say, trouble right in River City, why sure, I'm a billiard player
Certainly, mighty proud I say, I'm always mighty proud to say it
I consider that the hours I spend with a cue in my hand are golden
Help you cultivate horse sense and a cool head and a keen eye
Did you ever take and try to find and iron-clad leave for yourself
From a three-rail billiard shot?
But just as I say it takes judgement, brains and maturity to score
In a balkline game, I say that any boob
Can take and shove a ball in a pocket
And I call that sloth the first big step on the road to the depths of deg-ra-day
I say, first, medicinal wine from a teaspoon, then beer from a bottle
And the next thing you know your son is playing for money in a pinch-back suit
And listenin' to some big outta town jasper, hearin' him tell about horse race gamblin'
Not a wholesome trottin' race, no, but a race where they set down right on the horse
Like to see some stuck-up jockey boy, settin' on Dan Patch? Make your blood boil
Well I should say
Now friends, let me tell you what I mean
You got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 pockets in a table
Pockets that mark the difference between a gentleman and a bum
With a capital "B" and that rhymes with "P" and that stands for pool
And all week long your River City youth'll be fritterin' away
I say, your young men will be fritterin'
Fritterin' away their noontime, suppertime, choretime too
Get the ball in the pocket, never mind gettin' dandelions pulled
Or the screen door patched or the beef steak pounded
Never mind pumpin' any water, 'til your parents are caught with the cistern empty
On a Saturday night and that's trouble
Yes, you got lots and lots of trouble, I'm thinkin' of the kids in the knickerbockers
Shirt-tail young ones, peekin' in the pool hall window after school
You got trouble, folks, right here in River City, trouble with a capital "T"
And that rhymes with "P" and that stands for pool
Now I know all you folks are the right kind of parents
I'm gonna be perfectly frank
Would you like to know what kinda conversation goes on while they're loafing around that hall?
They be tryin' out Bevo, tryin' out cubebs
Tryin' out Tailor Mades like cigarette fiends
And braggin' all about how they're gonna cover up a tell-tale breath with Sen-Sen
One fine night, they leave the pool hall
Heading for the dance at the Arm'ry
Libertine men and scarlet women, and ragtime, shameless music
That'll grab your son, your daughter with the arms of a jungle, animal instinct
Mass-staria
Friends, the idle brain is the devil's playground
Trouble (oh, we got trouble)
Right here in River City (right here in River City)
With a capital "T" and that rhymes with "P" and that stands for pool (that stands for pool)
We've surely got trouble (we've surely got trouble)
Right here in River City (right here)
Gotta figure out a way to keep the young ones moral after school
(Our children's children gonna have trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble)
Mothers of River City, heed that warning before it's too late
Watch for the tell-tale signs of corruption
The minute your son leaves the house
Does he re-buckle his knickerbockers below the knee?
Is there a nicotine stain on his index finger?
A dime novel hidden in the corn crib?
Is he starting to memorise jokes from Cap'n Billy's Whiz Bang?
Are certain words creeping into his conversation
Words like, like "swell"? (Trouble, trouble, trouble)
And so's your old man? (Trouble, trouble, trouble)
Well if so, my friends, you got trouble (oh we got trouble)
Right here in River City (right here in River City)
With a capital "T" and that rhymes with "P" and that stands for pool (that stands for pool)
We've surely got trouble (we've surely got trouble)
Right here in River City (right here)
Remember the Maine, Plymouth Rock and the Golden Rule
(Our children's children gonna have trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble)
Oh, we got trouble, we're in terrible, terrible trouble
That game with the fifteen numbered balls is a devil's tool (devil's tool)
Oh, yes we got trouble, trouble, trouble
(Oh yes we got trouble here, we got big, big trouble)
With a "T" (with a capital "T")
Gotta rhyme it with "P" (gotta rhyme with "P")
And that stands for pool (that stands for pool)

<h2> Don't You Worry About A Thing - Stevie Wonder</h2>

Everybody's got a thing
But some don't know how to handle it
Always reachin' out in vain
Just taking the things not worth having but
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama

When you get fooled by smiling faces but
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
'Cause I'll be standing on the side

A chance to check out the new
But you're the only one to see
The changes you take yourself through but
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, pretty mama
'Cause I'll be standing in the wings
When you check it out

<h2> Bulls On Parade - Rage Agaisnt The Machines</h2> 
<p>
Come wit' it now
Come wit' it now
The microphone explodes, shattering the molds
Either drop the hits like De La O or get the fuck off the commode
Wit' the sure shot, sure to make the bodies drop
Drop and don't copy yo, don't call this a co-op
Terror rains drenchin', quenchin' the thirst of the power dons
That five sided fist-a-gon
The rotten sore on the face of mother earth gets bigger
The triggers cold empty ya purse
Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
Weapons not food, not homes, not shoes
Not need, just feed the war cannibal animal
I walk the corner to the rubble that used to be a library
Line up to the mind cemetery now
What we don't know keeps the contracts alive and movin'
They don't gotta burn the books they just remove 'em
While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells
Rally 'round the family, pockets full of shells
Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells

<h2> 2112 - Rush</h2>
<p>
And the meek shall inherit the earth
We've taken care of everything
The words you hear the songs you sing
The pictures that give pleasure to your eyes
It's one for all and all for one<br><br>
We work together common sons
Never need to wonder how or why
We are the priests, of the temples of syrinx
Our great computers fill the hallowed halls<br><br>
We are the priests, of the temples of syrinx
All the gifts of life are held within our walls
Look around this world we made
Equality our stock in trade<br><br>
Come and join the brotherhood of man
Oh, what a nice contented world
Let the banners be unfurled<br><br>
Hold the red star proudly high in hand
We are the priests, of the temples of syrinx
Our great computers fill the hallowed halls
We are the priests, of the temples of syrinx<br><br>
All the gifts of life are held within our walls
I know it's most unusual
To come before you so
But I've found an ancient miracle<br><br>
I thought that you should know
Listen to my music
And hear what it can do
There's something here as strong as life
I know that it will reach you
Yes, we know it's nothing new
It's just a waste of time
We have no need for ancient ways
The world is doing fine
Another toy will help destroy
The elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim
It doesn't fit the plan
I can't believe you're saying
These things just can't be true
Our world could use this beauty
Just think what we might do
Listen to my music
And hear what it can do
There's something here that's as strong as life
I know that it will reach you
Don't annoy us further
Oh, we have our work to do
Just think about the average
What use have they for you?
Another toy will help destroy
The elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim
It doesn't fit the plan

<h2> Free Bird - Lynard Skynard </h2>
<p>
If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be traveling on now
'Cause there's too many places I've got to see
But if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And the bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
The Lord knows I can't change
Bye-bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah, yeah
Though this feeling I can't change
But please don't take it so badly
'Cause the Lord knows I'm to blame
But if I stay here with you girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And the bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
The Lord knows I can't change
Lord, help me, I can't change
Lord, I can't change
Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah

<h2> Rappers Delight - Sugar Hill Gang </h2>
<p>
Now what you hear is not a test, I'm rappin' to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
You see, I am Wonder Mike, and I'd like to say hello
To the black, to the white, the red, and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first I gotta bang-bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang-bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the riddle that'll make your body rock
Well, so far you've heard my voice, but I brought two friends along
And next on the mic is my man Hank
And come on, Hank, sing that song!
Check it out, I'm the C-A-S an' the O-V-A, and the rest is F-L-Y
You see, I go by the code of the doctor of the mix and these reasons, I'll tell ya why
You see, I'm six-foot-one and I'm tons of fun and I dress to a T
You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali, and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars that definitely ain't the wack
I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunroof Cadillac
So after school, I take a dip in the pool, which really is on the wall
I got a color TV so I can see the Knicks play basketball
Hear me talkin' 'bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money than a sucker could ever spend
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the Rucker not a dime 'til I made it again
Everybody go "Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today? (say what?)
'Cause I'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go "Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn!"
Say, if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend
A Master Gee, am I mellow?
It's on you, so what you gonna do?
Well, it's on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said a M-A-S, a T-E-R, a G with a double E
I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world by all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm goin' down in history as the baddest rapper there could ever be
Now I'm feelin' the highs and ya feelin' the lows
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
Ya start poppin' ya fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while you're sittin' in your seat
And then, damn, ya start doin' the freak
I said damn, right outta your seat
Then ya throw your hands high in the air
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care
With the sureshot MCs for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A-singing on and on and on, on and on
Like a hot ready to pop the pop the pop dibbie-dibbie
Pop the pop-pop, you don't dare stop
A-come alive, y'all, gimme what you got
I guess by now, you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride
'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singing on and on and on, on and on
Rock-rock, y'all, throw it on the floor
I'm gonna freak ya here, I'm gonna freak ya there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere
'Cause I'm one of a kind, and I'll shock your mind
I'll put the tick, tick, tickets in your behind
I said a-one, two, three, four
Come on, girls, get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme what ya got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said a-one, two, three, four
Tell me, Wonder Mike, what are you waitin' for?
Said a hip-hop, the hippie to the hippie
The hip, hip-a-hop and you don't stop rockin'
To the bang, bang the boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
A-skiddlee bebop, we rock a scooby-doo
And guess what, America, we love you
'Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul
You could rock 'til you're a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
But we're like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up, a-baby bubba
Baby bubba to the boogie, the bang-bang, the boogie
To the beat, beat, it's so unique
Come on, everybody, and dance to the beat
Ever went over a friend's house to eat and the food just ain't no good?
I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed, and the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can, by sayin' that you're full
And then your friend says, "Momma, he just being polite, he ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!"
And so your heart starts pumpin', and you think of a lie, and you say that you already ate
And your friend says, "Man, there's plenty of food!" so you pile some more on your plate
And while the stinky foods steamin' your mind starts to dreamin' of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottin' into something that looks like cheese
Oh, so you say, "That's it, I got to leave this place! I don't care what these people think
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous with this ugly food that stinks!"
And so you bust out the door while it's still closed, still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief from a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later to see how he has been
And he says, "I understand about the food, baby bubbah, but we're still friends"
A with a hip-hop, the hippie to the hippie
The hip, hip-hop and you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

<h2>Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen</h2>

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro, magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
بِسْمِ ٱللَّٰهِ
No, we will not let you go (let him go)
بِسْمِ ٱللَّٰهِ
We will not let you go (let him go)
بِسْمِ ٱللَّٰهِ

Will not let you go (let me go)
Never, never, never, never let me go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia
Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
Ooh
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

<h1> Stuff I've Written</h1>
    <h2>The Twilight Infirmary</h2> 
<p>
(Ron Charles slowly awakes in a hospital bed after a car crash he was involved in. Nurse Rosemary Turner is in front of Ron’s bed sweeping the floor)

					   Ron
Patrick…? Martha…? Help please…

                                                       Nurse Turner
Dr Gafford!! Come quick, he's awake!!
			  (Rushes out the room to get Dr. Gafford)
					
					Ron
PATRICK..! MARTHA…! WHERE AM I?! PATRICK!!

			  (Dr. Gafford and Nurse Tuner burst in and rush to Ron who is still shouting his friend's name)
		
				     Dr. Gafford
			(holding down Ron with Nurse Turner)
Shh it’s okay you’re all right now my friend (Sedates Ron) Just sleep tight for now. 

		                  (Ron falls asleep as both leave)

				     Dr. Gafford 
			(Enters as Ron begins to awake again)
Good morning Mr. Charles! You, my friend, had quite a wild night, so I brought you some breakfast that’ll hopefully put you at ease. (Places the tray of food down and pulls out a newspaper) Ha! It looks like your accident made the front page, congratulations kid! (Chuckles and hands Ron the newspaper)

					Ron
No...this- this isn’t right.

				      Dr. Gafford
			(Peering through the window blinds)
What? Did they misspell your name? I hate it when they do that!!

				            Ron
No I mean, why am I the only one in the picture?
					Dr. Gafford
Mr. Charles, would you mind explaining that night to me?
			
					      Ron
I was with my friends Martha and Patrick. They were with me in that car. Patrick was sitting next to me, Martha was in the back and we…we were coming home from some skiing resort. We were driving down a backroad when all of a sudden a bright light appeared, then blackness, and now I’m here. 

					Dr. Gafford
				(turns around, a bit uneasy)
And you’re sure Martha and Patrick were with you the entire time?

					     Ron
Yes

					Dr. Gafford 
And you’re sure you saw a bright light?

					       Ron
Yes!

				           Dr. Gafford 
Mr. Charles, did you happen to accidentally take any form of hallucinogens that night?

					    Ron
				           (Annoyed)
Jesus God no...I know Patrick and Martha were with me that night, will you just please tell me why the hell they aren’t pictured in the newspaper. 

				           Dr. Gafford 
					  (sighs)
Because the police report noted that you were the only survivor

   Ron 
What?!

					Dr. Gafford
When the police got to the shoulder you crashed on, your body was the only one that was present. 
					     Ron
				(trying to take out his IVs)
Tell them to go back and search!! Please we’re in the middle of Winter, they'll freeze to death out there!! 

					Dr. Gafford
Calm down Mr. Charles. Look if you give me the last names of your friends, I’ll call around to see if any other hospitals around the area have had them admitted recently. But, you have to promise me (pointing to Ron’s attempted escape) you won’t try any funny business, deal?

					     Ron
Deal.

			(Dr. Gafford gathers up Ron’s breakfast and Newspaper and leaves Ron's room as it slowly transitions to night as Ron falls asleep. Ron then quickly wakes up to his hospital room which is only visible from the moonlight shining through the blinds)


					       Ron
		    (sits up and takes a deep breath, looking at the window)
Hey Patrick. Hey Martha. I miss you guys. Things here are weird. Word is, you guys don’t exist! (chuckling to himself) It seems I’m the only one here that remembers you guys are out there. And dammit I’m going to prove it. 

            (Ron begins ripping off his Iv’s and then stands up, stumbling, staring at the window) 
Okay Ron, let’s just take this slow...the window isn’t that far. 

		 		(begins taking slow steps)
Left...right...Left....L-no Right...Le	
	(Falls and passes out which leads to the doors opening revealing Dr. Gafford and Nurse Turner entering Ron's room. They pick up Ron and begin to carry him to his bed.)

					Nurse Turner
Are they ready to pick him up?

					  Dr. Gafford 
Not now, he’s not fully ready yet. Soon though. We’ll see how tomorrow goes and if everything goes as expected then he’ll be. Make sure you do something about that window soon. 

				        Nurse Turner 
Yes sir  
				          (both leave)

	          (Dr. Gafford enters, Ron lays in his bed with a bruise on his forehead )
				           Dr. Gafford
Rise and shine Mr. Charles! You got yourself a visitor coming soon!

					   Ron
What? A visitor? 

				          Dr. Gafford 
			     (Grabbing a cloth and warm water)
That's right, kid! We don’t want you looking like you just went through a 13 rounder with Ali.
  Ron 
 (Ron inspects his forehead as he feels a bruise, then the warm cloth)
I walked.

				          Dr. Gafford
You slept walked to be exact. It’s a common side effect after you wake from a coma. It's only temporary so don’t worry.  

					  Ron
No, I was awake. I was trying to walk. Then I heard these voices. 

				         Dr. Gafford 
The imagination can be very intense during the period of one's sleepwalking Mr. Charles
                            (Presses the cloth deep on the bruise, Ron cringes)
But I promise you, it’s only temporary. 

		 (Nurse Turner enters rolling in Patrick in a wheelchair)
				        Nurse Turner
Dr. Gafford. Patrick is ready.

					Ron 
Patrick? Where did you find him?

					Dr. Gafford
Vermont State Sanatorium. Apparently he’s been residing there for the past 4 years after he got himself into a nasty work accident that broke him mentally in half. Oh that reminds me. 
   (Places bell on Patricks lap) 
			
					       Ron
What's that for?

					Dr. Gafford
So he can communicate. Reports say that Patrick became mute shortly after his accident, so this bell is essentially his talk box now. All you have to do is sit back and listen as I’ll be the one asking questions. 

					        Ron
Mute? Patrick, what are they talking about?
(No response from Patrick)
Patrick, please answer me.
(No response)
CAN YOU EVEN HEAR ME PATRICK PLEASE!!


					        Patrick
(rings bell)

					     Dr. Gafford 
That's enough Mr. Charles. Now Mr. Burton, I’ll start you off easy, is your full name Patrick Earl Burton?
					       Patrick
(rings bell)
					   Dr. Gafford 
Good. Mr. Burton, do you happen to recall a night recently where you went on a skiing trip with my friend here Mr. Ron Charles?

					      Patrick
(No ring)

					   Dr. Gafford
Have you ever seen Mr. Ron Charles in your life Mr. Burton?

   					           Patrick
(no ring)  

						  Ron
Why aren’t you ringing that stupid bell Patrick! You know me! We grew up together on Maple Street, we were neighbors. We practically saw each other everyday! You lived in the yellow house, I lived in the blue house with the huge backyard where we would play cops and robbers.

					        Dr Gafford
Settle down Mr Charles please! Mr. Burton please forgive him but, do you remember growing up on Maple Street?

						Patrick
(Rings bell)
	
					        Dr. Gafford
Did you live in a yellow house Mr. Burton?

						Patrick
(Rings bell)

					         Dr. Gafford
Do you remember seeing Ron everyday while you lived on Maple Street?

						Patrick
(No ring)

						Dr. Gafford
Well Mr. Burton, that’s all the questions I have for you today. Thank you for allowing us to- 

						     Ron
Wait! Let me ask one question that can prove Patrick remembers me. Please, I’m begging you!

						Dr. Gafford
Is that okay with you, Mr Burton?

						   Patrick
(a moment of silence before Patrick rings his bell)

						Dr. Gafford
Proceed carefully with your question Mr. Charles.

						    Ron
Patrick, you better listen good. Remember when you came to my house late one night in a panic? You were telling me how you were digging yourself into debt and that you were so scared to tell Joyce about it. Remember how I promised to keep my mouth shut while I went ahead and paid off your debts? You have to remember that night Patrick, it was a long night for the both of us. 

						Patrick
(Begins slowly hyperventilating, trying to pronounce Ron’s name)
 Raw..! Raw! RON! RON! RON!
(Furiously hitting the bell repeatedly)

					        Dr. Gafford
Shh Shh Mr. Burton (injects a needle into his neck) just take it easy and sleep now. Nurse Turner will come pick you up shortly.
(Patrick falls asleep as Nurse Turner comes in and wheels him away.)
I’m extremely disappointed in your performance today Ron. You managed to turn an already broken man into a complete disaster. 

						Ron
He remembered me though! You saw it, he rang that bell and started shouting my name! He knows me.

						Dr. Gafford 
The only thing that boy knows anymore is how to get up in the morning and how to go to bed. I would think a bit about your actions before you go to bed Mr. Charles, as they could lead to consequences. 

(Dr. Gafford leaves as it transitions to night again, Ron is still awake looking at the window)

						Ron
(repeats the same process as last night, but this time using a chair as a walker.) 
I know what you bastards are doing to me. I-Im being experimented on, yes that's it. You’re finished with Patrick and I'm next in line. You won’t have control over me! You hear me Gafford!! (Ron reaches the window, then his hospital door opens revealing Dr. Gafford holding a syringe)
     Dr. Gafford 
Trouble sleeping Ron?

                                                                      Ron
No no no you stay away! I’ve already seen the damage you’ve done to Patrick through your experimentations, making him mute so he won’t tell me your plan. I’m not going to let it happen to me! 
			
					     Dr. Gafford 
(Walking over to Ron) I told you Mr. Charles, you need to think about your actions or you’ll have to suffer the consequences. I hate to say this my friend but this is your last straw. 

						Ron
I said stay away you-you asshole! (attempts to push the chair, but it misses Gafford completely, resulting in Ron falling)
No Ron, get up! You were so close…

					     Dr. Gafford
(kneeling down) I wish I could’ve helped get you back to your normal self, I had such high hopes for you Ron. Ah, no worries though, come tomorrow you’ll be on the right path. (sedates Ron) Now, you gotta get your beauty sleep before you face the music tomorrow. (Brings Ron to bed)

(Dr. Gafford leaves and then returns but this time with Nurse Turner to see Ron is awake and smiling on this new day)


						Ron
Good morning you two! Nurse Turner if it wouldn’t be any trouble, could I please have a glass of water? I’m feeling a bit parched! (chuckling)

					       Nurse Turner
Oh of course Mr. Charles! I’m glad to see you smiling this morning. (leaves)

						Ron
Dr. Gafford, I'd like to apologize to you. I’m sorry that my sleepwalking has gotten out of hand recently. Without your help, I don’t know what would happen to me!

					     Dr. Gafford
It’s quite alright Mr. Charles! I’m just glad to see you in high spirits!
					   Nurse Turner
(With a glass of water) Here you go honey! (hands glass to Ron)

					          Ron
(Finishes the water then smashes it and holds Nurse Turner hostage by pointing the broken glass towards her neck. Begins walking backwards towards the window) 

					    Dr. Gafford
				 (walking calmly towards Ron)
Listen to me Ron, think about what you’r-

					         Ron
Shut up! Shut up! SHUT UP! Stop telling me what to think! I hear your voices in my head trying to endlessly destroy me, but I won’t let it happen because you’re too late! (reaches the window and throws Nurse Turner to the floor) Finally! It’s over now, I can be free!! (Laughing hysterically as he rips off the window blinds to reveal a normal Vermont city covered in beautiful snow. Ron suddenly stops laughing)
		
					    Dr. Gafford 
What's wrong Mr. Charles?

					          Ron
The city...it's not what I expected, I almost forgot what it looks like. There’s Harry’s Pub. I had my first drink there with Harry and my pop. Oh and over there! That’s the hardware store that Roy owned. That's where I had my first job! (chuckling, with tears forming) God...I remember everything about these places, the smells, people, events. But, do they even remember me? Do they know I exist still? I...EXIST!! (Smashes a whole through the window) 

(Two men from the Vermont State Sanitorium enter and hold Ron down)

					   Dr. Gafford
I’m sorry it had to come to this, Ron. But, we’re going to have to transfer you to the Vermont State Sanitorium. Your mental state has gone completely haywire. There's nothing we could do anymore. But don’t worry, this is a good place, you’ll be happy.

					          Ron
No you can’t do this to me! I belong out there! They’ll remember me I promise! Go get Harry, or Roy or anyone in that city you’ll see, I promise! 

   Dr. Gafford 
(Grabbing a syringe) I’m sorry Ron. Give Patrick my best wishes, will you? (injects syringe into Rons neck)

						Ron
(breaks free but is feeling the effects of the syringe) 
This isn’t...happening. This is...all a dream! Yes, a-a...dream. (walking backwards towards the window) When I wake up...I’ll see Patrick...Martha...t-the resort. Everything...will be..back to...normal. All...I have..to...do is...wake up. (A VSS employee grabs Ron’s ankle. Ron kicks him off, slipping as Ron falls out the window.)

<h2> A Paper Abour Disinformation</h2> 
<p>
   Intro
Imagine this, it’s a normal day and you're peacefully sitting in your house reading the Sunday paper while waiting for your morning coffee. As you flip to the news column with your coffee almost ready, you hear a knock on your front door. You get up from your chair to answer it and there greeting you is a door to door salesperson holding an odd looking bracelet. This salesperson tells you that within this bracelet, is a nano technology that has the ability to amplify the neurons in your body to increase your overall health and endurance. They tell you that there is no payment necessary for the bracelet, as long as you can do a balancing test to prove the power of the bracelet. 
	What would you do? Would you take this salesperson up on their offer and win a free bracelet with some pretty sounding abilities? Or would you pause for a minute and think to yourself, ‘what's the validity behind this statement?’? While the latter would of course be the most logical answer to go with, a majority of individuals worldwide, spanning from athletes, political figures, celebrities and everyday people, fell for the Power Balance/Phiten craze that was from about 2004 till the start of the 2010’s. 
	I’ll briefly go over what the Power Balance and Phiten companies are. Power Balance and Phiten are wellness/holistic companies that sell health jewelry mainly, however they offer other health products such as shirts and compression patches. It is important to note that Power Balance was famous for their bracelets, while Phiten was known for their necklaces. These bracelets and necklaces ‘promised’ the wearer that what they’re wearing has the ability to improve their overall health and well being. 
	Now an obvious question here that you may be asking yourself is, ‘why should I care about someone lying about a little bracelet or necklace?’. Advertising is a powerful tool that we’re constantly surrounded by. With advertising, you have the ability to spread any message you want to whatever groups of people you want, and these messages can have a psychological effect on those people who view it. With this much accessibility at one's disposal, they also have the ability to easily bend reality and advertising disinformation just like Phiten and Power Balance did. 
While this type of disinformation may not be harmful to an individual's actual health as this is a case of disinformed advertising generating a simple placebo effect, it still has an effect on the trust between advertisers and the public. In order to analyze the cases of disinformed advertising, I will be using a lens of intersectionality to help put myself in the perspective of others from across the globe. Phiten is a company that originated in Japan while Power Balance was developed in the United States. To be more  culturally specific, Phiten comes from a mainly culturally collectivist background while Power Balance an individualistic one. 
	The importance of this is similar to the advertising factor, we come into contact with a vast array of cultures on a daily basis that all have different cultural ways of communicating and advertising. With how dominant our interactions with a multitude of cultures is becoming whether it’s in person, online, the news, etc, I feel like it’s important for us to be aware and have some basic understanding of how different cultures can communicate. This rings true especially in the disinformation setting as one could easily take advantage of another's culture by spreading disinformation due to limitations in communication and understanding. 
	The general question that I am looking to ask within this paper is, what culturally specific ways in which individuals from individualistic and collectivistic cultures promote disinformation in advertising. To help make this paper easy to follow when discussing this topic, I will provide a road map of sorts. After this paragraph, I will describe what collectivistic and individualistic cultures are, then will be my literature review that highlights the sources I use and their significance in the paper, then after that I will ask my research question, which will be followed by my methodology that I used for my research, then next will be my findings, then my analysis/conclusion, and then finally my ideas for future research. Collectivistic/Individualistic Cultures 
		      Collectivistic and Individualistic Cultures
For those unfamiliar to what collectivistic and individualistic cultures are, allow me briefly to explain. Individualistic cultures mainly focus on the self and their right of passage, it’s a go getter type of society. A great and relatable example of an individualistic culture is our American culture. Our American culture is centered around self expression, making a name for yourself, and individual opportunities for success, group though isn’t heavily normalized. Collectivistic cultures like Japan or Korea, focus on their community and respect for those in it more than focusing on self expression. Individuals in collectivistic cultures would rather sacrifice personal gain as it meant better their community group as a whole. In short, individualistic cultures focus on their own self (the individual) while collectivistic groups focus on their community (Collection of people). 
  				       Literature Review 

This research study by Miriam Havelin of OCAD University looks to investigate the increasing problem of misinformation and disinformation spreading through the digital sphere in Canadian society. In this study, the researchers give context to how human behaviors interpret misinformation, the current state of how misinformation could be spread through digital platforms like online advertisements and social media, and the laws that Canada has passed to limit the spread of misinformation and disinformation. To test the spread of misinformation and disinformation, researchers conducted interviews, surveys and past literature. An important finding from this research is how Canadian citizens were divided between certain Canadian stakeholders about who should regulate online information. This article can help benefit the paper as it would give information on how Canadian advertising is run, the laws it has, and the ways people can be misinformed by it through specific tactics. 
The information in this book was written by the authors so they could strategize new ways to combat developing challenges in the global and digital business sphere. For my paper specifically, I’ll be focusing on the chapter where the authors talk about how Brazil reacted to unethical advertising. What researchers were mainly interested in was the reaction from Brazilian citizens when presented with misinformed advertising. What researchers found was how most of the participants in the study preferred to not take action for possible compensation when being misled by advertising. The importance of this book in the paper is the ways in which Brazilian markets advertise misinformation and how the ‘do nothing’ effect misinformed advertising can have on its residents.
	This research journal entry looks to investigate if the advertising tactics for current spiritual and herbal medicine in South Africa are still operating under ethical tactics. The author states how advertising for herbal medicine used to be traditionally done by word of mouth, which has overtime led itself into developing a number of controversies. The author then describes the moral wrongs in African medical advertisement. These wrongs were exaggerated competence, false guarantees, misinformation, false testimonials, and claims of source of herbs. The researcher concludes that while Africa has been successfully advertising herbal and spiritual medicine for years, they have been immoral at advertising at the same time. For the paper, this would help in explaining the misinformed advertising tactics that are in South Africa and the controversies that they’ve had. 
This research study looks to investigate the multitude of negative influences that can lead to unethical advertising through misinformation. To examine these negative influences of advertising, the researchers focused on four main points that they would center their research around. These four main points were positive practices of advertising, negative practices in advertising, the effects of misinformed and deceptive advertising, and Arab and international laws regarding advertising practices. Within these four topics the researchers give detailed descriptions on how negative influences can play into advertising, while also describing what types of influences there could be like moral, cultural, economical, and so on. The researchers also provide examples of advertisement promotions to help solidify their claims. In the paper, most of the focus is going to be focused on the four main points, as this will help explain certain misinformation tactics and advertising laws in different cultures. This would also serve as a base article for the paper as it highlights a multitude of negative advertising tactics and the harm it could cause.	
This research study from the Journal of Interactive Marketing looks to focus on how the  spread of fake news through social media sites, could lead to negative behavioral changes in consumers when engaging with advertisement brands. The researchers describe how misinformation through media outlets has risen in the digital sphere, making it difficult for potential marketers to solidify their position in the business. To see why there is a struggle, researchers conducted a study where they had participants engage in multiple news sources in which the researchers manipulated the source, the truthfulness, and brand knowledge. Researchers found that the truthfulness of the news doesn’t show significance of result on consumers' perceptions of a brand, but they did see signs where the perception of source credibility was heavily put into question and distrusted. For the paper, this study would serve as the base article to demonstrate the effects that misinformation in advertising could potentially have on reputations of business and people. 
What is missing from all the information collected is how these culturally specific tactics of promoting disinformation can relate and overlay into other cultural specific ways of advertising or perceiving disinformed advertisements, which is what I look to help add literature to.				
     Research Question
My research question for this paper is, what are the similarities or differences that are found between individualistic and collectivistic cultures when they engage in cultural specific disinformed advertising. The reason why I’m asking such a specific question is because of how limited research there is on this topic and I want to expand the research on it. I also want this to be a new approach to my overall general question to this paper.  The significance of question as described earlier, is to bring awareness to the lack of literature surrounding the topic on ways that those from other cultures can advertise through culturally specific disinformation tactics. This question will also help us be more consciously aware of cultural specific factors in certain cultures and how they affect that culture and those outside it. 
Methodology 
My methodology that I will be using for this paper is a content analysis. A content analysis is basically researching and sourcing through a multitude of information either through online or text to help build a case for your research question. How I did my content analysis was by using scholar search engines like google scholar to help me source through peer reviewed and significant articles and empirical studies. The reason I picked using a content analysis as my methodology is because of the accessibility I have to the information since I will be using the internet. Whil;e I said I used mainly google scholar for concert information, I was still able to source through a multitude of videos or news articles that somewhat related to my topic that I could talk about and mention.  A limitation that came with this method was having to rely on written statements rather than getting peoples thoughts or emotions about my question though an interview or survey. This method could have given me a lot of different and personal perspectives on cultural disinformation through advertising and the effects it can have on the public, but due to time restraints and lack of resources is why I’m focusing only on their similarities and differences. 
                                       Findings
	The results that I ended up finding during my research was what I was expecting, but I also discovered some new things. What I expected to find was individualistic and collectivistic cultures integrating disinformation tactics, which I did find examples of through the usage of biases. Individualistic cultures relied on confirmation biases, which is only seeing your side of things even when told that your side is factually wrong, when promoting disinformation through advertising. Collectivistic cultures had a more tribalism bias view, which is when you focus on your community and disregard others that don’t conform to your group. 
	While in my findings I didn’t see the best examples of individualistic cultures using disinformed tribalism biases to advertise, I did find both individualistic and collectivistic cultures using confirmation bias when promoting disinformation in advertising. For my individualistic group, we go to Germany in 2015 during the The Volkswagen Group Emission Scandal. This is when members of The Volkswagen Group purposefully lied about the amount of turbo they put in their latest models of cars in order to reach the vehicle standards during American testing. As a result of personal influence getting in the way, it resulted in these cars emitting a dangerous pollutant known as NOx at an alarmingly high rate. We can see collectivistic cultures using confirmation bias like that in the Phiten company as they use a secret formula called aqua titanium. While aqua titanium was debunked for not having an effect related to performance, Phiten still continues to disinform the public by advertising Phiten and the “amazing” abilities that it still has.
	Something that I discovered that I didn’t expect were individualistic and collectivistic cultures using tribalism bias, but for more as a public response. Some examples of this could be found in laws that are passed worldwide regarding foreign advertising. In Latin American countries, which are mainly collectivistic, some governments reject foreign advertising as they fear the harm it could potentially cause. In heavily individualistic countries like Sweden, we can see them play a heavy part in restricting certain advertisements as they care for protecting their community, mainly the children. We can also see a tribalism response form in the public sphere as well, such as in a study that was conducted in Brazil in 2014 about deceptive advertising. In this study, Brazilian researchers presented a group of Brazilian individuals with disinformed advertising, and the response from the public that the researchers found were very similar. A majority of the individuals knew that it was deceptive advertising, but purposely chose not to speak up about it. This is most likely due to those group members wanting to save face, as saving face is a large trait found in collectivistic cultures. and not stand out in the community for speaking up against an authoritarian figure. 
			  Analysis/Conclusion
	
	The way I read the data is that, there is evidence that both culture groups engage in confirmation biases when engaging in promoting disinformation when advertising while more public and government spheres engage in tribalism bias. When looking at my research question, I would say what I found barley scratched the surface of the topic I was researching. While I do produce findings that do explain some cultural variables that go into promoting or perceiving disinformation, I know I could have researched deeper. However, I do believe that what I found is significant as it still sheds light to a very broad topic that is already lacking the data and research needed to properly discuss the topic. The findings that I found can potentially make us more aware and informed on how collectivistic and individualistic cultures engage in advertising. With AI becoming a new tool in advertising, we could see a total switch in how cultural disinformation tactics are used when promoting advertising or when an individual is receiving said culturally disinformed information
 Ideas For Future Research
	While a limitation I listed was lack of research in the question I’m looking to answer, another limitation I found myself in was time restraints. During my time writing this paper and researching information, I was really cut for time as I was balancing a number of other priorities. If you’re going to research a topic like this, I would say to set aside a lot of time for yourself as there are a lot of sources you have gone through a lot of stopping and thinking when analyzing if a disinformation tactic was a form of collectivism or individualism. I would also say another recommendation I would do is, study the history of advertising and basic tactics. When I was researching I found myself really confused by some of the terms and language used to describe advertising tactics from all over the world. While I have a passion for advertising and love the history of it, I really went in over my head about this topic as I left with some more questions than more answers. Despite these personal limitations, I still heavily encourage those to do research and expand the knowledge of this topic as it will inform us what to look for when we are presented with culturally disinformed advertising tactics whether it be from our own culture or an outside one.

		          Band of Characters 

Doug- Our 20 something year old main protagonist who is a student at the University of Mary Washington, their roommate is a serial killer, yet Doug is extremely unaware of the situation. Doug is not a fan of when Jesse does their “art” projects as it usually messes up the apartment that Doug tries to keep clean at all times, but Doug does consider Jesse a friend. Doug can be played by anyone. Their character is inspired from Danny Tanner of Full House and Larry David from Curb Your Enthusiasm. 

Jesse- Our 20 something year old antagonist. Student at University of Mary Washington and is Doug’s roommate. They're a serial killer in the most obvious ways and they don’t really try to hide it anymore since Doug is super unobservant. They don’t consider Doug a friend but more of as someone who can use their trunk to help transport dead bodies. Isn’t an art student at UMW, instead an accounting major (revealed at end). They can be played by anyone and interpreted in any way, comedic or super serious would work. Characters inspired from Billy and Stu from scream. 

Mark- 20 something year old Dead body, friend of Mark friend 1 and mark friend 2 

Mark friend 1 & 2- two close friends of Mark. Later start the Mark patrol to find him, but end up getting murdered by Jesse 

Bio’s and characters names will have some changes to them over time, but this is our basic layout for now. 


			    Shot Location 
Steve's apartment (Day/possibly night)

Bottom of the HCC (Day/Night

Woods area near campus (Scope it out during day and see how we feel about doing it at night)


 
INT.  STEVE’S APARTMENT - DAY

We open with a WS of a murder scene in the center of the apartment that just happened. In this wide shot, we can see two plastic tarps, one on the floor and the other on the wall. With an over the top bloody, dead body laying on the tarp. After this WS, the next couple scenes will be quick extreme close ups of different aspects of the room to help disgust what is going on in the scene. Some of the shots will be of the hand of the dead body, the tools the killer’s using, and cleaning the knife. The scene after cleaning the knife scene will be a medium tracking shot (?) of the killer walking out of the kitchen with a blood stain rag around their shoulder and eating a fruit cup. The next scene could be a WS of them cleaning up their space and in the middle of this action, they hear the door knob begin to jiggle. This will then move into a CS shot reverse shot of the killer’s worried look and then back to the door knob jiggling with the door eventually opening. With a MS, In will walk our main protagonist’s roommate who just came back from grocery shopping, Doug. Doug is listening to very loud music with their eyes closed and copying the screaming in the song. 

Doug 
(Walks into the apartment with a head-on frontal view tracking MS following Doug as they’re invested in their music. To help show this investment, our protagonist could headbang or do some form of physical expression)

The tracking MS should end on the side of Doug, doing a medium profile shot. Doug will bump into the dead body,this could be a CS of the shoe hitting the body, resulting in him opening their eyes. Doug looks down at what they bumped into, while still jamming to their tunes. As Doug realizes what they see in front of them, instead of screaming along to the song, they are now doing a genuine scream as they see the scene in front of them. 
(If we have enough time, I would like to do a scene of Doug dropping the grocery bag they're carrying as they first realize what they see before the genuine scream. It would be a low CS of Dougs right leg with the grocery bag falling into frame next to their leg. In this shot, the serial killer roommate would be on the very right of the frame to help fill the rule of thirds)

   Doug
(perspective shot of dead body as we see Doug back away in shock)
OOOOOOH MYYYYY GAA..(annoyed, realizing this is another one of Jesse’s “art” projects)..AAAHH C’MON!!

After this realization, the camera cuts to an over the shoulder shot of SKR. During this scene Doug has gathered themselves, but they’re still annoyed at Jesse. 

    Doug
(If we do the grocery bag idea, we can have Doug picking it up during this bit.) 
Jesse, How many times have I told you about this. When you do your art projects-

Camera cuts to an over the shoulder shot of Doug, with Jesse joining in on what Doug is saying 

 			  Jesse & Doug
Do it at Melchers.(Jesse taking over conversation) I know, I know Im sorry. 

Camera will cut to the perspective of the camera that Jesse has set up. During this perspective we can see Doug crossing over awkwardly over the dead body

Doug 
Like, I just waxed the floors and- (looks down at dead bodies face)is that…Mark?

	Jesse
   Yeah

Doug
Oh, hi Mark. You really janked up his face for this project. What’s the point of this one?

Jesse
(Takes a deep breath…)Abstract.(he exhales) 

Doug
Ah. (Doug crosses over dead body, camera cuts back to Jesse's perspective of Doug as they begin walking backwards to their room) Anyway, can you have this cleaned up by dinner? (Before Doug enters their room)Is Mark staying for dinner?

Jesse
(Camera cuts to a medium shot of Jesse standing in the middle of hallway eating their fruit cup as they turn their head towards Mark. They turn their head back to Doug, shaking it in a ‘no’ response)
No 
          (Finishes fruit cup, chug the fruit cup)

While the fruit cup is being finished, the screen will fade to black revealing our title card. 

EXT. BOTTOM OF HCC WHERE THE ROUND TABLES ARE - DAY

If we could do a panning shot during the fade in to our next scene, starting from above Doug down to them working on their laptop, that would be cool. Instead if we can’t, it could just be a simple static MS of Doug working on their laptop. During this scene is where Mark’s friends will come to ask Doug about his whereabouts. For this, I was thinking of doing a tense misleading scare with a couple S/R/S of Doug doing work, a perspective shot of Mark’s friends coming up to Doug, then back to Doug doing work. The last shot could be a perspective shot with Mark's friends tapping Doug’s shoulder with Doug turning around, being spooked. This will then turn into a semi medium shot of Jay and Toby crossing over Doug to sit in the chairs across from him. 


	Jay 
Hey Doug, could we ask you a quick question?

(Doug is a little startled by Mark’s friend suddenly appearing, but continuing to do his homework.)

					Doug
Yeah, what’s up

					Toby
We were with UMW Missing persons and we were wondering if you’ve seen Mark at all today. He never came home from work last night.  

Doug
(breaking away from his work a bit) I mean, yeah he was at our place last night helping Jesse with his art projects. But Jesse told me he drove him home before dinner. 

					Jay 
		Well, did you see Mark leave with Jesse?
		
					Doug
		    (uncertain) Yeah…
Camera cuts back to a MS of Jay and Toby looking concerned at Doug. 
					Doug 
				   I think?

Toby and Jay both groan, looking up at the sky as they are heavily disappointed in Doug’s response. Camera cuts back to Doug looking at them awkwardly and going back to his work During this moment)

					Toby 
Look, we have a patrol going on tonight to find him. (hands Doug a Mark Patrol flier) Would you care to help?
	
					Doug 
	(looks up from work, grabbing a flier, slowly crumbling it up) I mean, I don’t really know Mark that well so…no?

Camera cuts back to Toby and Jay as they both push their inner pain through smiles, Toby could ball up their hand and then turn it into a wave goodbye. As Toby and Jay leave, The camera will cut to a wide side shot of Toby and Jay leaving. During this moment, Doug's head will be turning to watch the leave. The camera will cut to a MS of when Doug turns his head back from watching Mark's friends leave as now Doug is back in the apartment still doing his work. Jesse is across from Doug eating an apple with a knife while reading a magazine  

INT. STEVE’S APARTMENT- NIGHT
    Doug
		
Hey Jesse, uh, are you sure Mark made it home last night?

Jesse: 
(heavily engaged in eating his apple & magazine)
 yeah he walked last night 

Doug looks back towards where Jesse’s “art project” was, with it no longer being there and the floors looking clean, with a faint stain possibly. Camera could be a side MS of Doug looking at the floor or a front shot/POV type style. Zoom up shot on Doug’s face when he says this next line, could do a side eye looking back at Jesse for dramatic effect

				  Doug
			(A TAD bit suspicious)
	I thought you said you drove him home last night

 Jesse 
(Chokes on apple realizing his mistake)
*Coughs* Yeah, I sai- *COUGHS, panting* yeah I meant he WALKED to my car to get in it and go home. 
			
				  Doug 
Oh, makes sense. (Goes back to typing) 

Both characters go back to doing the activities they were doing which is portrayed by a WS. During this shot we can see Doug visually slowly growing uneasy and messing up on his typing at the thought of Mark. He’s finally overwhelmed and gets up quickly to get his coat to go look for Mark. When Doug gets up, Jesse looks up quickly too. 

Doug
I think I need to join the Mark patrol. 

				Jesse
		Mark Patrol?

				Doug
Yeah it's like (hands flier to jesse) this search group that's looking for Mark. Listen If you hear anythi-

				Jesse
(cutting Doug off, gets up quickly, moving towards the door) No-no I’ll go and join them. Mark was my responsibility, not yours. (opens door)

				Doug
		Can I finish your apple?
				Jesse
		Uh yeah go for it (shuts door)

		
Side WS of Doug grabbing and eating the apple,camera fades to black. Lens cap transition will appear which goes into the live action mark patrol scene 		





.  

Doug 
		(Waves holding cookout) Oh hey guys, whats the occasion for the party hats? Did you find Mark?

Doug walks over and sees Jesse’s camera, becoming a little nosey as to what Jesse’s odd “art” project is this time. Doug flicks through the footage as it does a S/R/S with the last shot ending on a zoom of Doug's horrified reaction to seeing Mark’s friends killed. Jesse then appears in the middle of the hallway, this time cutting up a grape or pomegranate and eating it. 

Jesse: “So… you found the camera, huh?”

Doug: (stammers) Bro… you’re into some fucked up art, they look really like dead, how’d you do it?  

Jesse just stares at Doug for a moment, their expression of seriousness briefly turning into a look of confusion. The camera cuts to Doug, who just stares back with an unreadable expression. 

Jesse: “That’s because they are dead, (frustrated) God if you had just stayed out of it, things would have worked out for you. But noooo, you had to go and get suspicious. Now, you’ve forced me to get rid of one of my most useful tools.”

Cut to Doug who is visibly confused.

Doug: “What tool?”

Cut to Jesse, with a “really dude?” type of expression.

Jesse: “You, idiot.”

Doug: (slowly realizing) “Oh… oh, wait, shit, me? I'm the tool? Like you’re going to kill me?”

Jesse: Yes, dumbass, you’re too much of a liability for me to keep around anymore. I only ever needed you because you were such a stupid mule. I wish you had stayed as blind as Helen Keller; now I have to find someone else to help take care of my ‘art projects.’

Jesse takes a few confident steps towards Doug, who just looks genuinely hurt at Jesse’s comments. Jesse grips the knife tighter, but keeps it down at his side, blade pointing towards Doug. Doug glances at the knife and then back at Jesse, who has stopped moving. They are about three paces away from each other.

Doug: “That explains the smell. I really just thought you were hella stinky and needed some deodorant.”

Jesse looks at Doug with slight shock at his stupidity and lack of awareness.

Jesse: (exasperated) “I truly don’t think I’ll find anyone as dull as you. I’ll miss that brain of yours.” 

Jesse gets more visibly agitated and starts to descend closer to Doug 

Doug: “Are you sure you want to do this? (puts fist up)I have a Bruce Lee poster” 

Jesse begins to lunge at Doug with the knife, after a couple close calls, Doug disarms Jesse and picks up the knife. Cuts to a side wide shot of Doug pointing the knife at Jesse. 

				Doug
O-okay c'mon man were friends, it doesn’t have to be this way ya know? 

				Jesse 
	(out of breath) were not friends, were not roommates, (takes a deep breath) and I’m not even an art major! 

Camera cuts to a MS of Doug looking mad and hurt, he begins to lunge towards Jesse screaming as he impales him. Camera cuts to Jesse over Doug’s shoulder as blood spits from his mouth. Doug then holds Jesse in his arms with a close shot of a dying jesse as he looks at Doug to say his final words

Jesse 
Ow 

Jesse dies, Doug slowly looks up to camera with a surprised look on his face, which slowly creeps into a smile. 

Doug
That felt…good. 
Camera cuts to an angled shot of Doug laughing as he raises his hands up to the air while holding the knife and laughing. Camera fades to black  




Kasey’s 2nd Attempt at an Ending

With the darkness from the camera being turned off, the scene will transition with Doug entering into a dark apartment that is barely lit with red lighting. Jesse has set up the dead bodies of Mark's friend on the couch with party hats on and his camera facing them. Doug cautiously walks into the apartment as it's a bit hard for him to see, but he notices the dead bodies of Mark’s friends.  

Doug 
(Waves holding cookout) Oh hey guys, what's the occasion for the party hats? Did you find Mark?

Doug walks over and sees Jesse’s camera, becoming a little nosey as to what Jesse’s odd “art” project is this time. Doug flicks through the footage as it does a S/R/S with the last shot ending on a zoom of Doug's horrified reaction to seeing Mark’s friends killed. Jesse then appears in the middle of the hallway, this time cutting up a grape or pomegranate and eating it. 

Jesse
So… you found the camera, huh?

Doug
(stammers) Bro… you’re into some fucked up art, they look really like dead, how’d you do it?  

Jesse just stares at Doug for a moment, their expression of seriousness briefly turning into a look of confusion. The camera cuts to Doug, who just stares back with an unreadable expression. 

Jesse
That’s because they are dead, (frustrated) God if you had just stayed out of it, things would have worked out for you. But noooo, you had to go and dig around. Now, I'm gonna have to look for a new roommate for next semester.

Cut to Doug who is visibly confused.

Doug
Wait, why?

Cut to Jesse, with a “really dude?” type of expression.

Jesse
I’m… kinda gonna kill you, dude.

Doug
(slowly realizing) Oh… oh, wait, shit, for real?

Jesse
Yes, dumbass, you’re too much of a liability for me to keep around anymore. (sneering) Unless you planned on keeping quiet forever?

Jesse begins to take a few confident steps towards Doug, who is frozen with uncertainty. Jesse grips the knife tighter, but keeps it down at his side, blade pointing towards Doug. Doug glances at the knife and then back at Jesse, who has stopped moving. They are about three paces away from each other.

Doug
So is this why the place always smelled bad? I really just thought you were a stinky dude and needed some deodorant.

Jesse looks at Doug with slight shock at his stupidity and lack of awareness.

Jesse
(exasperated) It was probably both.

Jesse gets more visibly agitated and starts to descend closer to Doug 

Doug 
Are you sure you want to do this? (puts fist up)I have a Bruce Lee poster…

Jesse begins to lunge at Doug with the knife, but after a couple close calls, Doug disarms Jesse and picks up the knife. Cuts to a side wide shot of Doug pointing the knife at Jesse. 

				Doug
Don’t make me do this, man… Can’t we just stay friends? 

				




Jesse 
	(out of breath) We’re not friends, we’re not roommates, (takes a deep breath) and I’m not even an Art Major! 

Camera cuts to a MS of Doug looking shocked with his jaw dropped. He begins to lunge towards Jesse, screaming as he impales him. Camera cuts to Jesse over Doug’s shoulder as blood spits from his mouth. Doug then holds Jesse in his arms with a close shot of a dying Jesse as he looks at Doug to say his final words

Jesse 
Ouchie

Jesse dies, Doug slowly looks up to camera with a surprised look on his face, which slowly creeps into a smile. 

Doug
That felt…good. 
Camera cuts to an angled shot of Doug laughing as he raises his hands up to the air while holding the knife and laughing. Camera fades to black

<h2> My Final Paper For Positive Psychology </h2>
<p>
Part 1 
Part A:
Out of the 4 evidence-based activities we were tasked with doing this summer semester, as well as the ones we read about in our textbook, the one that I felt increased my well-being the most was our beauty log. The beauty log is a form of journalism in which an individual engages in recording 3 daily experiences: beautiful events found in nature, beautiful objects made by people, and morally beautiful or inspirational actions. Why I think a beauty log best suited me is because the concept our text talks about in the section, Finding Beauty Outside the Arts. In this section, our text describes how people shouldn’t limit themselves to finding only traditional beautiful things, such as art or poetry, as the main standard. Our text says that instead, people can find beauty in a numerous non-traditional forms such as scientific equations, lines of code, or doing good deeds. Our text mentioned how out of the 3 categories, people found that moral beauty to be the most impactful to their well-being. 
While I love art and going to galleries in my free time, I do enjoy focusing on the beauty that is surrounded by me in my daily life. I think what makes this evidence based activity important and impactful is that it has you focusing on being mindful of the environment around you and how it is affecting you. Our text describes mindfulness as a state of consciousness in which we are aware of what is happening in the present with a sense of care and receptive attitude. Within the two approaches of mindfulness our text described, I would say that I found myself going down the more Langer approach. In Langer’s approach to mindfulness, it is noted that mindfulness can help people can generate new thinking patterns, acting, and receptive feelings towards change all just by focusing on your process of living. 
I had a very good and enjoyable experience with this beauty log as it was nice to be more in tune with my environment, while also thinking deeply about how these experiences can benefit my well-beingI think a notable example could come from my birthday. I turned 22 and had a party with all my close friends at an arcade 10 minutes from my place. Before we left to go to the arcade, we discussed how long we would be staying there and what to do for our after party when we get back. As we were enjoying ourselves at the arcade, we began to lose track of time as we were staying way longer than we originally planned. Some of went outside to take a break and I was informed by a couple of my friends that they wouldn’t be staying after due to how late we’ll probably be leaving. While that did bum me out for a bit, I began to start thinking ‘we’re not leaving yet, everybody’s still here having a good time so I’ll make the most of it’. I continued to have that mindset throughout the whole night and had a really good time. When everyone parted ways it was a bit sad as I began to feel getting into adulthood as I was now unsure when I would see them again, but I was proud of myself that I didn’t have that mindset the whole night and let it ruin it. 
Part B:
I think why this is a good fit for me was because of how in tune with the environment and other aspects it requires you to be. I’m so busy all the time I forget to take a minute and savor the beauty that is around me all the time. What also worked for me when doing this lounge was acknowledging when people did morally beautiful actions. I know it wasn’t required in our activity, but I’m an easily empathic person, so whenever I see someone doing any amount of morally good actions, I’m heavily moved. This would help increase my well-being as I was able to make someone's day after they made someone's day, and it’s a whole pay it forward motion. 

Part C:
When looking at the WOOP method, my wish is to keep noticing and appreciating the beauty that is all around me. My outcome would be having a positively high well-being while also being inspired by the beauty around me to work on personal projects. My obstacle would be my own self as I engage in negative self talk and doubts. My plan would be to just simply believe in myself and know what I make is good. If I negatively self talk, then I will watch my favorite videos I made to remind myself what I can do when I put in the work. 

Part 2 
Part A:
When reading this textbook, there were a lot of new concepts regarding positive emotion and well-being that I learned. I think the one that stuck with me the most was the concept of affective forecasting. Affective forecasting is when we predict or expect to know exactly how we will feel about a certain situation or event. A reason why this stuck with me is because it made me realize that I unconsciously engaged in affective forecasting all the time during my adolescence. There are moments I can remember when I shot down a lot of experiences and opportunities from families and friends because I got in my head too much telling myself  I wouldn’t enjoy it. There were also times when I would shoot it down because of me striving to look ‘cool’ would get in the way, so I would affectively forecast that those events would tarnish my reputation. 
What makes this even more bittersweet is that those who engage in affective forecasting tend to be wrong about how they thought they would feel versus when compared to how they felt. I still find myself holding onto regrets about negatively forecasting and missing out on some experiences that I knew deep down, I probably would’ve enjoyed. There are also things I regret missing out on that I affectively forecasted as non-beneficial to me like educational lectures about what to do after college, as I realize now how important those lectures are and to not take them for granted. I try not to hold on to this regret though, as I try to use it as a way to grow, learn, and move on. 
Part B:
That last sentence is why I think affective forecasting is an important topic to focus on as it can lead to someone missing out on important experiences. I personally think that is a message that everyone needs to learn and understand. If I had to identify a specific audience to educate about affective forecasting, however, it would be those who are entering high school. I think why this is important to learn before starting high school because as everyone says, you’ll be experiencing a lot of new things in high school. As we learned in our text, having an open mind to new experiences while being mindful about them, can help in increasing our overall well-being. What is also important about being open to new experiences is that it can help us figure out what we like/are comfortable with and what we don’t like/aren’t comfortable with.
Part C:
The product that I created to help convey this message was a short video essay. I felt like this method was the best approach because of how popular video essays are with adolescents and emerging adults. When making this video, I tried to make it as ‘trendy’ as possible for high school students, but still attention grabbing and educational for other audiences.

<h2> Notes that I Took From Chapter 7 Of Our Positive Psychology Textbook</h2>
<p>
Excellence, Aesthetics, Creativity, and Genius
People who exhibit excellence can perform some behavior, talent, or skill much more fluently and expertly than others. Excellence has been defined as the acquisition of extraordinary skill in a specific area of expertise
 skill or talent can be anything—from basket weaving to theoretical physics
Excellence is more nurture than nature 

Pursuit Of Excellence Foundations of Excellence
Despite the intuitive appeal of innateness, considerable research suggests that learning is more important than biology for the acquisition of extraordinary skills
amateurs who are given opportunities for intensive practice can indeed mimic the superior abilities of experts.
 In addition, studies have shown that even child prodigies typically learn their skills in the same way as ordinary people do
difference is not so much in innate capability but in the fact that prodigies start to learn their craft earlier than others and work harder at perfecting their skills. 
learning of excellence is supported by the fact that for many skills and talents, the accomplishments of absolute top performers are constantly bested by the next generation
Ericsson and Charness (1994) boldly stated, “Our analysis has shown that the central mechanisms mediating the superior performance of experts are acquired; therefore acquisition of relevant knowledge and skills may be the major limiting factor in attaining expert performance” 
Development of Excellence
Adriaan de Groot, who was an expert chess player, published his studies of chess masters. In his initial work, he demonstrated that chess masters could remember the positions of chess pieces on a board with incredible accuracy after only brief exposure to the chessboard.
Later studies, however, showed that chess masters were no better than others at remembering positions of pieces placed randomly on a chessboard

 What appeared to be an obvious advantage of memory was only possible if the pieces on the board meaningfully represented arrangements found in a real chess game. Therefore, chess masters were not better at overall memory skills but, more limitedly, at recognizing familiar chess patterns learned over years of experience
Real excellence involves cognitive skills, the first element of which is a large knowledge base in the specific domain. 
In addition to memory skills for relevant aspects of their interest area and a large knowledge base, research shows that expert performers also tap into well-organized cognitive schema
s not just a random collection of facts but rather an organized cluster of information that involves numerous conceptual linkages
A second element in expert performance is the motivational factor of commitment
Finally, the most important factor in the acquisition of expert performance is that of practice
. This is important in at least three ways. First, those who truly excel at a specific discipline often begin to practice early in life. Studies have found that people who reached higher levels of expertise tended to begin regular practice schedules 2 to 5 times earlier than less masterful, though still talented, performers. Second, those who are most accomplished tend to practice more hours each day or week than others. Ericsson, Krampe, and Tesch-Römer (1993) found that by age 20, top-level violinists had practiced on average about 10,000 or more hours over the years. This figure was about 2,500 more than those violinists ranked at the second highest level of accomplishment. Again, it should be realized that this secondary level of expertise was filled with highly accomplished 338 musicians.
Consistency of practice is also crucial in the development of expertise. The most accomplished musicians practice approximately 4 hours per day, 7 days per week.
Third, in addition to practice time, studies have found that a particular style of practice called deliberate practice is important.
defined as practice that is focused, planned, concentrated, and effortful
 Deliberate practice is focused on the immediate task with attention at every moment to what one is doing correctly or incorrectly
That is, the 10,000 hours figure is merely an average number. With some skills, it may take less time, 339 and with other skills, such as those required for a concert-level classical musician, it usually takes even more time
researchers agree that deliberate practice is important but found that deliberate practice accounted for only about one third of the variation in expert performance, a figure much lower than Ericsson’s findings.
 recognized danger to what is known as overtraining
The 10-Year Rule 
The 10-year rule states that it takes at least a decade of dedicated, consistent practice before one can attain a high level of excellence
Although a minimum of 10 years seems to be necessary for superb performance, the age at which people generally attain recognition and make their big breakthroughs does vary across disciplines
Resonance 
Another perspective on excellence comes from the work of Doug Newburg and colleagues (Newburg, Kimiecik, Durand-Bush, & Doell, 2002). They created the concept of resonance
deemed this a cyclical process that guides the development of excellence in many areas of expertise
r model grounds excellence in a desire to experience specific emotions—namely, those associated with full engagement in a preferred activity
The resonance performance model (RPM) comprises four stages
 the dream, or the feelings a person experiences when engaged in an activity.
intense preparation along with consistent engaged practice
people encounter obstacles and enter the third stage.
when obstacles are encountered, people do not simply try harder. That is, they do not necessarily believe that “when the going gets tough, the tough get going.” Instead, they revisit their dream, or reconnect with the feelings that sparked their dream. This reconnection with original feelings allows them to embrace the obstacles, to avoid the trap of trying harder and enjoying it less, and thereby to move forward
Passion 
more obvious factors that must be involved in the attainment of excellence is dedication to, and even a passion for, one’s chosen area
 define passion as “a strong inclination toward a self-defining activity that one likes (or even loves) and finds important and in which one invests time and energy
So self-defining that they represent central features of one’s identity”
Vallerand clarified his concept of passion by postulating a “dualistic model” comprising two major types of passion
harmonious and obsessive. 
Harmonious passion is the result of autonomous motivation, is freely chosen, seems to “fit” with one’s identity, and is engaged in joyously and effortlessly
n activities based on harmonious passion are accompanied by flow, better for well being 
. Obsessive passion, however, results from feelings of being controlled, often involves rigid persistence, and may create conflicts within one’s identity and life, as well as feelings of anxiety and even shame.
 psychological addictions exemplify obsessive passion
Passion evolves over-time to produce performance outcomes.
harmonious passion increased goals for mastery and resulted in high-quality deliberate practice, which in turn predicted high-level performance or excellence
Studies have also found that greater harmonious passion, but not obsessive passion, is related to more frequent flow experiences
Those who had an obsessive passion tended to ruminate more about their passion while they were occupied in another activity
Passionate involvement in a social cause.
 obsessive passion has been associated with increased risk of burnout, especially among older persons
. An interesting study found that people who had harmonious passion were less likely to make affective forecasting errors about their area of passion
At least in sports performance, harmonious passion may exert its greatest effect if it helps meet one’s needs for autonomy, competence, relatedness, and achievement
harmonious passion and trait self-control may be complementary predictors of well-being
speculated that harmonious passion may also play a role in both hedonic and eudaimonic well-being.
proposes that harmonious passion for an activity can trigger positive emotions that in turn help nurture meaning and personal growth.
university students who reported one passion had higher well-being scores than those with no passion, but students with more than one passion actually had higher wellbeing scores than those with merely one passion.
whereas obsessive passion was related to both positive and negative outcomes
harmonious passion tended to have a greater relationship to life satisfaction for women
Cultural differences also emerged. For instance, harmonious passion was more related to life satisfaction in collectivist cultures (e.g., Asian) than in individualistic cultures (e.g., North American and European).
Grit 
Angela Lee Duckworth combined the ideas of passion and persistence into a new construct she calls grit
People who are self-disciplined and score high on measures of persistence and passion toward their goals are high in grit.
 Examining how grit impacts well-being, Jin and Kim (2017) could not find a direct relationship between grit and life satisfaction. Instead, it was only when grit was combined with the satisfaction of one’s needs for autonomy and competence that increased life satisfaction was observed
In other words, it may be that grit requires other elements of one’s life to be satisfied before grit exerts its effects. Another study found that grit failed to predict creativity
used a case study approach to show how a focus on grit as persistence can overstate the role of individual achievement and thereby minimize the impact of racism on one’s ability to reach desired goals. 
 found that people high in grit were more likely to persist even when they would incur costs and negative outcomes. That is, sustained persistence toward a goal that can never be reached will often decrease well-being.
Aesthetics and the Good Life 
Yet some people do live in this world—for it is the prison environment. 
Bleak
—beauty—that enhances our experience of being human.
n obvious relationship between beauty and 346 creativity
Aesthetics has been defined as “an appreciation of the beautiful and the sublime
They created the Appreciation of Beauty and Excellence Scale (ABE) to remedy the neglect and found the ABE correlated significantly with well-being and prosociality.

Why Is Aesthetics Important? 
Of course, art and creativity can increase our sense of well-being, satisfaction, and happiness
argued that art can be used as a tool for social change. Indeed, it has long been recognized that one of the first changes dictators often initiate is to suppress art forms unacceptable to their political ideology
 four attributes of aesthetics: pleasure, absorption, intrinsic interest, and challenge.

Pleasure
Gazing at an attractive object increases our sense of well-being—even if only momentarily. Witness in today’s world wherein a large percentage of disposable income is spent on jewelry, the latest fashions, furniture, cars, and “dream” homes. All are intended to bring their owners a greater sense of beauty.
Often such objects serve as stimuli for positive emotions by elevating us—even momentarily—from the day-to-day concerns that can consume our emotional lives if we are not careful. 

Absorption 
In Dewey’s view, an aesthetic sense is necessary for well-being because it creates a heightened vitality that is restorative. The aesthetic sense helps us to transcend the mundane by intensifying our relationship with immediate experience. It heightens our awareness, energizes our appreciation of the moment, and allows a more complete “interpenetrating of self and the world of objects and events” 

Intrinsic Interest 
Interesting objects, intriguing patterns, and unexpected color combinations can stimulate our sense of curiosity. 
, the fallout from the suppression of our aesthetic need is a view that life is boring.
artistic expression is often suppressed in childhood when children hear the message that “art” is something to be judged and only “creative” people can do it correctly. He contended that in adults this suppressed need for artistic expression creates a “festering source of dissatisfaction in quotidian living”
A frequent justification for arts education has often been that art fosters intellectual development
 arts in the schools can help children by providing emotional expression, teaching communication and persistence, engaging interests that fall outside traditional curricula, teaching the use of metaphor and imagination, and enhancing understanding of themselves and others.

Challenge 
less common, is as a pathway to greater personal growth. Art can also be used to express emotions, intuitions, and meanings that people find hard to express in words.
A powerful example of how art may impact us occurs when our personal boundaries of “acceptable” art are pushed.

Music and Well-Being 
Research on how music affects both listeners and players illustrates how the arts can impact well-being and other positive outcomes in life. The same general conclusions could be applied to any of the performing arts, such as dance or theater, as well as the fine arts, such as painting or drawing.
considerable research has been conducted on music and musicians. Listening to music is also one of the most frequently mentioned strategies people use to induce moods
most frequently mentioned emotions that people seek from music tend to be positive emotions such as joy, happiness, and love
 ability to recognize distinct emotions in music relates to one’s emotional intelligence
Seligman’s model posits that well-being can be predicted by examining five factors: positive emotions, engagement in life, positive relationships, meaningfulness, and accomplishments (i.e., PERMA).
Croom (2015) also identified several triggers that may help music produce positive emotions
 These include conditioning and expectancy (pairing music with certain positive memories), emotional contagion (the ability of the listener to feel the emotion expressed in the music), the positive visual imagery music can produce, and basic rhythmic responses that can be both learned and due to innate brain stem reflexes. 
That is, research has found that music can reliably induce emotions but only basic ones such as happiness, sadness, anger, and fear
c. Mood, mental clarity, tension, and cardiovascular health may be improved by listening to classical music and music designed for relaxation or meditation, but grunge rock and techno music may be 352 physiologically harmful
 emotional engagement with music. Clearly, music is enjoyable because people become engaged with melodies, lyrics, and the entire listening experience. In a way, people can engage in flow and savoring when listening to or performing music
how music can enhance relationships. Such enhancement can occur between two people who share the same musical tastes or have their own special romantic song, or it can be shared among many people who attend concerts or outdoor music festivals.
a sense of meaning, and music certainly can contribute to life’s being more meaningful. Music can help people express a sense of identity and can become part of how people define themselves and their relationships with others
accomplishment is important to music’s impact on well-being. At first, it may seem that this applies only to people who 353 play a musical instrument. However, many people become more accomplished music listeners over time as they learn more about their own musical tastes and how music affects them

Music and Health
 indicated that music can help patients heal faster after surgery, help cancer patients with the healing process, help Alzheimer’s patients to remember events from their past, help people cope better with severe pain, boost our immune systems, and even help children raise scholastic scores
The use of music therapy has seen a rapid rise in popularity as studies have found that the use of the proper type of music can help enhance pain-blocking nerve pathways, calm the central nervous system, and help regain healthy functioning in heart rate variability
singing has helped improve well-being and increased levels of oxytocin
c. Recent research on neuroplasticity and the brain has given new life to various therapies that use the arts. There is evidence that music can actually lead to increased brain size
found that the musicians’ corpus collosum was measurably larger. 
Using an fMRI machine, they measured blood flow in the brains of jazz musicians and rappers while they were improvising. The researchers found decreased activity in areas of the brain associated with self-monitoring and increased activity in self-expression and all sensory areas (Limb & Braun, 2008). Because this pattern is often seen in REM sleep, Limb speculated that improvising musicians may be in a state similar to a waking dream (see Zagorski, 2008). Last, a recent study found that stimulation of specific areas of the brain associated with pleasure and rewards leads to more enjoyment of music and an increased willingness to purchase music
Art therapy has also been useful in a variety of contexts. For example, 355 research has found that artistic expression can increase feelings of wellbeing and help people deal with the emotions associated with cancer
Participation in artistic expression may also help adjustment to dementia (Hannemann, 2006), provide relief from chronic disability (Reynolds & Prior, 2003), and enhance stress reduction
One study asked college students to keep a “beauty log” or diary to record beautiful events in nature, beautiful objects made by people, or events that were morally beautiful—that is, uplifting or inspirational (Diessner, Rust, Solom, Frost, & Parsons, 2006). Researchers found that the experience of moral beauty was especially associated with increased hope and wellbeing

Finding Beauty Outside the Arts 

Some scientists have even suggested that a scientific theory should be judged partially on its “elegance” or aesthetic appeal
Susan Fitzpatrick (2001) recalled how she entered the field of science because of the beauty she saw in the Krebs cycle of cellular respiration. She advised her colleagues to tell their students about “the moment you recognized beauty in the work of another scientist and fell in love” 

Origins of Aesthetic Sense 

 Kaplan (1992) argued for the “savannah hypothesis” that finds evolutionary significance in our elemental interest in and curiosity about landscapes, insofar as such traits encouraged early humans to explore their environment
Carl Jung suggested that our emotional responses to certain forms and images might be the result of innate responses from a deep collective unconscious
Ellen Dissanayake (2009) proposed that our aesthetic sense evolved from the early attachment between mothers and infants.
. For example, many people in Western societies find the music of India to be strangely discomforting. Primarily this is because Indian music uses a quartertone scale whereas Western music uses a halftone scale

Can Tragedy and Sadness Be Beautiful?

 Through the medium of art, people can experience tragedy and gain at least three benefits
First, empathy for characters reminds us of our shared humanity and may even serve to increase compassion and charity. 
Second, out of compassion we might resolve not to allow such tragedies to occur if we can prevent them.
Third, experiencing life’s sad and tragic moments through a substitute work of art enables us to feel certain emotions without having to live through the actual experiences that gave rise to them. 

Creativity 

Creating as a mean through which one derives pleasure, satisfaction, and a sense of well-being is actually common. Every day people around the world engage in hobbies, crafts, and amateur performances in the arts
. However, it is only within the last 200 years that the social role of artist has been created in contemporary society.
 Creativity is a quality that is enormously difficult to pin down. Dean Simonton (2009) defined it as “adaptive originality.” To be creative, an idea or product must be original, novel, surprising, or unexpected, and it must also be adaptive; that is, it must provide a useful solution to a real-life problem
These dual criteria mean that if you are the only person to see your latest painting as inventive, inspiring, and original, then it really isn’t creative.
John Nicholls (1972) suggested that the solution must be original and “make a meaningful contribution to culture.” From his perspective, if we find a novel and unique solution to the problem of how to dust our apartment, it may be considered clever but not true creativity

Little-c and Big-C Creativity 

One way to distinguish between types of creativity is to distinguish little-c from big-C creativity.
Little-c creativity enhances life by finding unique solutions to problems, but the solutions are not necessarily groundbreaking innovations
 “everyday creativity,” in which the focus is more on originality concerning routine or common problems
 big-C creativity transforms culture and history
 It is the creativity we associate with genius.
. Little-c and big-C creativity may represent differences of degree that fall along the same continuum

Research Perspectives on Creativity 

Creativity has also been a difficult subject for researchers to study, primarily due to the difficulty of measuring it. Psychological measurement scales usually rely on interval measurement, in which one indicator is higher or lower than another indicator
 they measure relative degrees of creativity.
 Evidence indicates that artistic excellence in one area does not translate into excellence in another.
One caveat to this general rule is that crossovers seem much easier within related artistic disciplines. For instance, it is fairly common for artists to be creative at both painting and sculpture because the media are closely related. Note that research does not indicate a difference in kind of creativity across domains. No matter what the medium or field, creative work evinces a few common elements
observed that four research traditions dominate the studies of creativity:
those focusing on person, process, press, and product
Studies of creative persons tend to investigate personality traits or other attributes associated with individuals. Process studies look at how creativity happens. Press refers to the environmental influences that may help or hinder creativity. Finally, a product approach focuses on actual outcomes of creativity. 

The Creative Person 

Studies have found that the correlations between tests of creativity and scores on standard IQ tests are usually between .10 and .30, that is, in the modest range
 Research studies have generally concluded that having an average to moderately high IQ is often associated with creativity and may even be beneficial to it, but it is not necessary to be creative
Personality characteristics of creative people do seem to overlap with those of people who achieve excellence. However, this relationship is a one-way street because not all people who achieve excellence are highly creative.
For a product to be novel and break new ground, its creator must thoroughly understand the existing ground. 
Highly creative people are indeed different from other people, and those differences enhance their ability to find the novel, unique, and unexpected.\
One consistent trait that creative people do tend to share is openness to experience
Greater openness implies a person more willing to consider the unusual, unexpected, out of the ordinary, and unconventional. Therefore, creative people tend to be highly flexible in their thinking and tolerant of ambiguity or even outright disorder
 Insofar as complex problems lead to more dead ends and exasperating failures, creative people may be marked by a higher tolerance for frustration.
Studies have also found that highly creative people tend to be independent.
being able to resist social pressures to behave and think in conventional ways.
” Rather than merely resisting social pressures to appear different, truly creative people resist conventions that are stifling to the freedom they need for their work.
may prefer to work alone so they can take their own path toward solutions. Because of this tendency, many creative people have seen themselves as loners
 Highly creative people also display a willingness to restructure problems or cognitive templates that have served people in the past, and play with ideas, traditions, existing forms, and solutions
Many researchers agree that creativity often involves tension and conflict, in particular, a struggle to resolve seemingly incompatible questions. Tardif and Sternberg (1988) observed that a quality of creative people is “what seems almost to be an aesthetic ability that allows such individuals to recognize ‘good’ problems in their field and apply themselves to these problems while ignoring others”
Creativity also is associated with being intrinsically motivated
Often they exhibit a passion for their area of focus. Working intensely on a creative endeavor may actually give them more personal energy rather than deplete it
Other personality characteristics associated with creativity include receptivity, sensitivity to problems, fluency in thinking, and a willingness to take risks
Therisa Amabile (1983) summarized three broad characteristics of creative persons. First, they are experts in their chosen field or artistic medium. Second, they use the cognitive skills and personality characteristics mentioned earlier. Third, they are intrinsically motivated

The Creative Process 

Styles of thinking have been associated with creativity, specifically convergent and divergent thinking
Convergent thinking is a process in which various problem-solving strategies converge on a single, correct answer to a problem.
Tests of convergent thinking often are scored in terms of whether a person has answered correctly
divergent thinking is an ability to think in many different ways, using various strategies that, at least initially, may not show any direct relevance to a solution

ability to produce many solutions to the same problem. 
, neither style is highly correlated with creativity (Barron & Harrington, 1981). Both may be necessary: divergent to generate ideas and convergent to take those idea and hone in on a solution

Role of the Unconscious in Creativity 

Sigmund Freud (1901/1960) associated creativity with the unconscious id, or primary process thinking, which he considered to be illogical, emotional, and symbolic
ideas have led to the notion, taken up by Jung, that creativity is related to an ability to tap into unconscious processes. 
for Jung, the level of the unconscious viewed as central to creativity, invention, and spontaneity is a deeper one.
Psychodynamic theorists have since proposed that creativity is based not on unconscious processing but on preconscious thinking
 The more influential of these perspectives came from Ernst Kris (1952) who contended that creativity resulted from a specific cognitive process he termed regression in service of the ego
This is an ability to temporarily submerge the rational and control functions of the ego and tap into cognitive processes that are more allegorical, symbolic, and holistic.
Natalie Rogers, daughter of Carl Rogers (see Chapter 9), created expressive arts therapy as a way for people to approach creative expression by submerging these rational ego control functions.
viewed artistic expression as a mean to access deep and often remote emotions as well as unconscious processes
 approach offer people an opportunity to explore their deepest emotions in a safe, supportive environment that values expression, spontaneity, and intuition over control and conformity. 
Rollo May (1975) presented an influential perspective on the creative process. Drawing on existentialist philosophy, he argued that genuine creativity involves an intense relationship or encounter in which the artist is fully absorbed in and engaged with the artistic subject.
. Like Friedrich Nietzsche, May proposed that genuine creativity gives access to both the Dionysian (that is, irrational) and the daimonic (that is, negative) forces of the psyche. May regarded creativity as evolving out of the tension between the positive and negative tendencies of who we are

Four Stages of the Creative Process 

The idea that creativity is somehow connected with unconscious or preconscious processes is also found in the renowned four-stage theory of creativity proposed by Joseph Wallas (1926).
 first stage is preparation, that is, a time when information is gathered, initial attempts to solve a problem are attempted, a variety of ideas are tossed around, and in general the stage is set for a creative solution
If a solution is not found, then the second stage of incubation begins. Here attempts to find a creative solution are handled at an “unconscious” level of processing. This stage can last hours or years
Baird et al. (2012) found that experiencing a wandering mind, or “engaging in an undemanding task,” facilitated the creative incubation period. However, recent research suggests that the creative incubation stage is a combination of less deliberate cognitive focus plus unconscious thought processes operating outside of awareness
third stage, termed illumination, is initiated when a creative solution emerges rapidly and unexpectedly as an insight. People will frequently recall answers emerging from dreams and other less rational avenues of cognitive processing, but an insight may be stimulated by more everyday occurrences
Many researchers recognize that what is commonly known as insight plays a relatively small, if important, part of the creative process—which may seem surprising. In this view, insight is not a special unconscious process but rather involves the use of ordinary cognitive skills at a preconscious level
This process leads to the last stage in this theory of the creative process, that of verification. Here the creative breakthrough must be worked with to give it final form. Often this entails work on turning an insight into a real-world solution with practical application.

Left Brain/Right Brain and Creativity
Although researchers initially dismissed this idea completely, some support exists for the distinction between cognitive processes performed by the left and right hemisphere
, research has found a small advantage in the left hemisphere for logical thought and in the right hemisphere for symbolic thinking (at least in right-handed people)
overall conclusion, however, is that both hemispheres are involved in both styles of thinking, and the differences between the two are a matter of emphasis

Creative Environments or Press 

Many highly creative people seem to have come from somewhat turbulent childhoods in which they received comparatively little emotional comfort. Interestingly, these families also were high in encouragement of their children to achieve, providing many opportunities and resources for learning and new experiences.
we must point out that among the factors that do not seem important to creativity is heredity. In studies that examined the characteristics of identical twins raised apart, correlations between the twins’ creativity scores were lower than correlations between their IQ scores (Nicholls, 1972).
Sometimes a unique group of people together can create a special synergy that allows for greater creativity
Creative people who regard themselves as loners tend to congregate in stimulating settings of similar minds.
Peter Rentfrow (2011) postulated a “creative class” of people in the United States today who partially drive its economic engine and congregate in areas more amenable to their iconoclastic tastes and sensibilities
“happy architecture.” Architecture that promotes well-being fosters a sense of higher values and promotes such qualities as balance, elegance, and harmony in building. Indeed, most people notice buildings that feel more comfortable than their ordinary counterparts
Some historical periods have notably nourished creativity, such as the Italian Renaissance, particularly in Florence, and at the end of the 19th century in America

The Product Approach to Creativity 

As mentioned earlier, a product approach focuses on the outcomes of creativity. Runco (2006) suggested that this approach can be objective insofar as products are quantifiable. A problem with such an approach, discussed in an upcoming section, is that those identified as geniuses do not necessarily fit the pattern found with other creative people. 

The Confluence Approach to Creativity 

 Guilford (1950) explained creativity as a cognitive function composed of multiple factors. Influenced by his perspective, later researchers have tried to group various approaches to creativity as representative of only one piece of a pie.
A confluence approach requires multiple factors in place for real creativity to occur. The confluence model proposed by Sternberg and Lubart (1995) stated that six resources need to 369 work together in creativity:
intellectual abilities, knowledge, personality traits, a motivational style, thinking styles, and an environment supportive of the creative process and output.
Barron (1988) argued that the relationship between persons and products (or problems) is what ignites creativity, analogous to an “open system of mutual interdependence.” This notion implies that creativity is not simply the product of a unique individual
Csikszentmihalyi (1997) proposed that for creativity to really flower, a special synergy of person, environment, culture, and historical time needs to take place.

How to Enhance the Potential for Creativity 

 Csikszentmihalyi’s work with flow was originally designed as a partial study of creativity. Indeed, highly creative people often refer to flow experiences during periods of total engagement in which creative juices are flowing
Flow may also be associated with intuition (Järvilehto, 2016). Some studies have found that positive mood can increase cognitive flexibility and thereby the potential for creativity
 Other studies do not support a link between positive mood and creativity (Kaufman, 2009). For example, one investigation found that positive mood only helped extroverts be more creative 
Curiously, trait mindfulness may not be related to intuition and, hence, to creativity. That is, Remmers, Topolinski, and Michalak (2015) found that trait mindfulness was negatively associated with intuition
Suggestions to improve creativity would be to follow your passions, take breaks when solutions don’t come easily, remember to do aerobic exercise, and broaden your perspective on life by exploring other cultures
The Knight Foundation created one of the more charming ways to stimulate creativity by supporting “random acts of culture” throughout the United States
We now know that an old standby recommendation for creativity, brainstorming, is ineffective. In the 1970s and 1980s, organizational psychologists often recommended getting together with others and collectively generating as many solutions as possible, even ridiculous ones, to enhance creativity. Research has found that this tactic does not help improve creativity
One question unanswered so far is whether being creative enhances wellbeing. So far, we have seen that creativity is useful, and the relationship to well-being has been implied.
 obvious that people who are passionate about their art will make large sacrifices to practice their craft. 
First, not everyone has a desire to be highly creative. Most people want to be involved in absorbing activities, and at times artistic pursuits fill that need, but that is not the same as wanting to be highly creative.
n Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, for example, he asserted that some people had a strong aesthetic need, but not everyone
 Second, for those who do wish to be highly creative, several factors impact well-being in addition to creativity. For instance, is the passion for creativity harmonious or obsessive?


Creativity and Personal Growth 

Interest in creativity and its role in personal growth often occurs outside the formal research traditions of psychology.
 Maslow (1971) referred to primary creativity as the ability to be inspired, to be taken up by the moment, and to perceive the world in new and unique ways
Averill (2002) has worked with what he calls emotional creativity or the ability to use emotions in creative ways to enhance life and expand potential
Nietzsche meant to embrace the full range of emotional expressions, both the highs and lows, to transcend more mundane approaches

Genius

During the Renaissance (probably, in part, due to persons like DaVinci) genius began to take on the meaning of some special talent or ability beyond the normal range. Since that time, it denotes a person of extraordinary creativity and inventiveness.
Those labeled as geniuses exhibited the same qualities associated with people who achieve excellence in their fields. They were intensely dedicated and committed to their area of expertise, extremely motivated, willing to work long and hard, and absorbed in a search for deeper knowledge about their craft.
often loners, they were so intensely involved in their work that they appeared self-absorbed.
in contrast to those who were “merely” creative, the geniuses tended to exhibit an extremely high level of self-confidence that might well be called arrogance.
Often they made friends only when they needed support and could abandon those friendships easily, quickly, and sometimes heartlessly if they felt it was necessary
 Despite this personality feature, creative geniuses all tended to find an older person—often prior to a big breakthrough—to serve as mentor. Yet this vital person in their lives could also be abandoned quickly.
Finally, Gardner suggested that many creative geniuses had made what he called a “Faustian bargain” in order to be creative. This refers to the medieval legend of Faust, a character who sold his soul to the devil to gain knowledge and power
contended that creative geniuses “strike a deal” with themselves: They will sacrifice something important to become creative and famous. Often sacrificed is the quality of their personal relationships in romance and marriage, parenthood, and friendship. Apparently, genius has its costs as well as its rewards

Genius and “Madness” 

One cost for some highly creative people has been mental illness. The association between creativity and mental problems is part of the popular conception of the creative artist. 
James Kaufman (2001) coined the term the Sylvia Plath ef ect after his study found female poets were more likely to suffer from mental illness than other female or male writers or eminent women from diverse occupations.
Kaufman (2009) later noted the unfortunate misinterpretation of his results to support a general link between creativity and mental illness, emphasizing that his results applied only to female poets and that the other creative women in his study did not show significantly more mental illness
. For little-c creativity, there is actually a positive relationship between creativity and mental health!
This is the opposite of the cultural assumption. With big-C creativity the picture becomes more complex.
 Genius-caliber creative people do tend to exhibit some personality traits associated with poor mental health, such as primary process thinking and nonconformity. However, they also possess compensatory characteristics that balance the impact of negative traits. That is, big-C creative people may have more effective coping skills than other people, and this capacity allows them to function effectively. 
 they indeed found that first-degree relatives of artists with bipolar disorder or cyclothymia were more creative 376 than a comparison group. However, when they investigated further, higher creativity scores were found for either relatives with cyclothymia or those who did not have a mood disorder, but not for relatives diagnosed with bipolar disorder
 In other words, creativity was more easily expressed in those who did not have the symptoms associated with bipolar disorder. Therefore, this study suggests that if there is a shared genetic contribution to both creativity and bipolar disorder, then serious mental illness such as bipolar disorder may actually inhibit the expression of creativity.

newer perspectives on development begin by assuming that we are active participants in shaping our own development.
people can also anticipate upcoming changes and prepare for them before life challenges turn into crises
Such approaches declare that adult development is a continuous process of anticipating the future, appraising and reappraising goals, adjusting to current realities, and regulating expectations so as to maintain a sense of well-being in the face of changing circumstances. 
It may seem obvious that how we think about well-being, happiness, and satisfaction with life will change in some ways as we mature.
Several studies have specifically investigated how our sense of well-being can change as we age and are inevitably challenged by the vicissitudes of life
In any culture, as people grow throughout adulthood a variety of significant life events require change and adjustment
. Such types of challenges are referred to as normative life events; depending on the particular culture, these might include launching a career, marriage, becoming a parent or grandparent, and retirement.
 Unexpected life challenges, such as an illness or financial crisis, are referred to as non-normative life events
people generally adopt two basic methods of adjustment: assimilation and accommodation. 
Adjustments that use assimilation allow us to keep striving without major alterations in goals, assumptions, or our sense of identity
For instance, the goal of becoming a world-famous chef does not have to be abandoned when one’s first child is born, but how that goal is pursued will certainly need to be altered to fit the new role of parent
. Adjustments that use accommodation require us to change goals, assumptions, or identities because the old ones are no longer workable
For example, after the paralysis of his left hand, Robert Schumann was forced to abandon his desire to be a concert pianist. 
 Earlier research on the adaptability to change often referred to the trait of ego resiliency defined as the ability to adapt flexibly to challenges and restore a sense of positive well-being
 Studies have found that high ego resiliency at age 21 predicted positive adaptation to challenges many years later in life

Well-Being Over The Life Span 
In the study of personality development over time, researchers have used three basic models to understand life changes: stage or growth models, life span models, and life course models
 Stage or growth models postulate recognizable stages that need to be addressed, roughly at different ages
life span models do not postulate age-specific challenges but rather see personality development as a continuous process of adjustment to challenges
viewed in terms of various phases of life such as adolescence, early adulthood, and middle adulthood
Life course models also tend to look at phases of life but emphasize the social role demands at each phase
These models may be more sensitive to cultural and historical differences in social role expectations. 

Stage Models and Well-Being 

The most famous perspective on life stages in Western psychology has been Erik Erikson’s (1950) eight stages of psychosocial development
Erikson’s theory presents a captivating idea in that each life stage is defined by a specific “crisis” or challenging situation that compels us to move out of our comfort zone and seek a readjustment to changing life circumstances
The successful resolution of each crisis helps to build a specific “virtue.”
One often-overlooked aspect of Erikson’s theory concerns how each stage challenge is resolved
. The immediate assumption for many people is that the “positive” pole (e.g., trust) takes precedence, and the “negative” pole (e.g., mistrust) loses influence over behavior. That is, most people assume that one pole “wins” and the opposite pole “loses.
Erikson assumed that a successful resolution of each stage challenge resulted in the two poles finding a healthy balance.
“dynamic balance of opposites”
Erikson continues by describing unhealthy consequences if each pole is taken to an extreme
The overuse of the negative pole at each stage resulted in a specific “malignant tendency.” 
the overuse of the positive pole at each stage resulted in a “maladaptive tendency”
Erikson says that healthy psychosocial development requires finding both balance and moderation between the two poles of each stage crisis, albeit a balance that favors the positive pole. Balance requires incorporating the adaptive elements of each pole, and moderation requires not taking each pole to an unhealthy extreme that will inhibit healthy personality development. 
Studies on Erikson’s stages have found that greater maturity in adulthood is associated with movement through Erikson’s stages and resolution of stage crises as he hypothesized
 a 45-year longitudinal study of women examined Erikson’s last stage of ego integrity versus despair and found, as expected, that one’s ego integrity was predictive of better intimate relationships and higher psychological wellbeing (James & Zarrett, 2006). The researchers also found that identity status in 1951 predicted one’s level of generativity in 1996. Stage seven of Erikson’s stage theory, generativity versus stagnation, has recently been the focus of considerable research interest.
Erikson’s stage theory, generativity versus stagnation, has recently been the focus of considerable research interest.

Generativity: Nurturing and Guiding Others
Erikson, Erikson, and Kivnick (1986) defined generativity as “the responsibility for each generation of adults to bear, nurture, and guide those people who will succeed them as adults, as well as to develop and maintain those societal institutions and natural resources without which successive generations will not be able to survive”
, studies have shown that a higher level of generativity is associated with greater well-being
generativity is also associated with other factors related to increasing maturity or greater personal growth
 found an association between generativity and the use of more principled moral reasoning, a balance between individualistic and communal concerns, and an increasing importance of other-directed behaviors in midlife
, generativity seems to be related to many traits that are central to the concept of the good life
 found that increased generativity was the best predictor of well-being in midlife adults. Greater generativity is also associated with having more education and being at least middle aged 
 However, women tend to be more generative than men, probably due to women’s higher scores on empathy
found that simply being exposed to combat during the war was unrelated to psychosocial adjustment and maturity, but men who had endured high combat exposure and were more generative showed higher subsequent psychological growth, maturity, and wisdom. Higher generativity seemed to help the men adjust better and even to thrive
Dan McAdams and his colleagues analyzed life narratives to assess generativity. They found that the identities of highly generative people, as revealed through their life stories, were often partially constructed with a commitment script
. A common theme in this type of life narrative is that initial difficulties in life were faced, which then led to a greater sensitivity to others’suffering and, finally, to a positive outcome that benefited society. 
seems that part of the self-identities of highly generative people are based on a personal life story that emphasizes overcoming difficulties and, as a result, growing into greater understanding, empathy, and compassion for others
Another intriguing finding is that highly generative people had not experienced either more positive events or fewer stresses compared with less generative people; rather, the difference between highly generative people and others was in how those life events were interpreted.
generative people, both positive and negative life events were seen as events that fostered empathy, compassion, and a deeper understanding of others
 Vaillant presented a series of six developmental life tasks: identity, intimacy, career consolidation, generativity, keeper of meaning (or wisdom), and integrity.
 postulated that the mastery of all life tasks is the hallmark of successful aging, given continuous refinement 
 Life Span and Life Course Models and Well-Being 
A substantial body of research has found that the processes we use to create a sense of well-being may differ at different phases of life

Positive Youth Development
In psychology’s early years, its leading thinkers believed that the preteen years and adolescence were a time of “storm and stress,” 
However, today’s studies of development have found many pathways through adolescence, and most of these involve little upheaval or storm and stress
positive youth development, which assumes that youth possess resources that can be developed, nurtured, and cultivated. Strength-based assessments of children have identified a variety of strengths, virtues, and positive character traits that help children and adolescents not simply to adapt but to thrive and flourish as they enter adulthood. 
. Some of these strengths include hope, optimism, and benefit finding or the ability to reinterpret seemingly negative events in a positive light (Kirschman, Johnson, Bender, & Roberts, 2009). Of course, curiosity and openness to experiences must be added to this list. 
Richard Lerner (2009) presented positive youth development as a process that fosters the “Five C’s”
 competence, confidence, connection, character, and caring.
argued that young people whose lives actively seek to nurture and develop these qualities may be described a “thriving youth.” 
Lerner suggested that a “6th C” should be added to the list: contribution, or the effort to be involved in helping or serving others.
Possibly the major resource for positive youth development is the alignment of young people and the social contexts in which they live, contexts such as families, schools, and community organizations. 
 These supportive contexts are referred to as developmental assets- positive youth development is not only focused on developing individual strengths in youth but devotes significant effort to developing a good relationship among young people and social community resources. 
Examples of developmental assets outside the home include churches, YMCA or activity centers, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, 4-H Clubs, and colleges and universities.
The Penn Resiliency Program is devoted to positive youth development and evolved from research on optimistic and pessimistic explanatory styles. It teaches children learned optimism or how to reinterpret life events in a more positive and realistic fashion
Children who go through the program have been able to avoid symptoms of depression, show increased optimism, and are even healthier

Early and Middle Adulthood 
Jochen Brandtstädter (2002) investigated how people pursue goals as they encounter the vicissitudes of life. In particular, he postulated a dual-process model of adaptation and adjustment:
 First, as people pursue goals they may run into obstacles and difficulties that require them to intensify efforts or alter paths toward goals. These are assimilative processes because they keep the original goal intact.
. Second, important goals may become impossible to attain or substantially blocked. At such times, a person must use accommodative processes to adjust by downgrading the importance of the goal, switching to a new goal, or using other strategies to adapt to the loss of an important goal.
Brandtstader found that both assimilative and accommodative processes can lead to a sense of well-being and life satisfaction after unexpected life events force us to adjust our original goals.
William James (1896/1919) declared that we increase our sense of self-esteem by either succeeding more or by giving up our “pretensions”—our overly ambitious goals and self-evaluations.
 Ryff and Heidrich (1997) found that participation in positive social and leisure activities was associated with greater well-being for younger people, during middle age positive relationships were most important, and for an older group well-being was associated more with previous educational and work experiences.
s. Derek Isaacowitz, George Vaillant, and Martin Seligman (2003) examined the relative importance of personal strengths at different ages. They found that younger groups reported more strengths concerned with exploring their worlds and that the strength of hope was a predictor of life satisfaction
the middle-aged group, life satisfaction was predicted only by a higher capacity for loving relationships.
 In the older group, there was more self reported usage of interpersonal and self-regulatory strengths. 
 Older persons often have a smaller discrepancy between their life goals or aspirations and their actual achievements in life; this feature tends to increase the sense of happiness and life satisfaction
The differences between ideal-self and actual-self rating also seems to vary with age. Heidrich (1996) found that for younger and middle-aged groups, significant differences existed between their ideal-and actual-self ratings. However, for an older group, their ideal-and actual-self rating were similar.
When compared to young people, older persons are also more satisfied with their accomplishments and their present life but less satisfied with their anticipated futures
 Satisfaction with social relationships 391 has been found to be more important for older persons
Ryff and Singer (1998) highlighted several studies using Ryff’s Psychological Well-Being Scale. Their results showed that some scale scores increased as people age (e.g., autonomy, environmental mastery, and self-acceptance), some decrease (e.g., purpose in life and personal growth), and still others remain relatively stable throughout life (e.g., positive relationships with others and self-acceptance), although there were gender differences among the scale scores
The researchers attributed the decrease in personal growth and purpose in life to retirement and a change in social roles
Conclusions drawn about the relationships between life phases and wellbeing may also depend on how well-being is measured. Corey Keyes, Dov Shmotkin, and Carol Ryff (2002) examined different age groups in terms of both subjective well-being (SWB) and psychological well-being (PWB, i.e., Ryff’s Psychological Well-Being Scale).
 found that those who had both high SWB and high PWB were more likely to be midlife or older, with a higher level of education; they were also more conscientious and extraverted and had lower neuroticism scores.
Younger people with less education tended to be found in the groups low on either measure of well-being. Adults with higher PWB than SWB tended to be younger, better educated, and more open to experiences than adults who had higher SWB than PWB.

Is There a Midlife Crisis? 
David Blanchflower and Andrew Oswald (2007) examined the relationship between age and well-being in a huge sample of over 2 million people from nearly 80 countries. When they viewed a subset of a half million people from American and Europe, they found that well-being tended to be relatively high at younger ages, decrease in midlife, and then rise again after about age 60.
Therefore, they argued that well-being shows a U-shaped curve over the course of the life span.
. Women reach their minimum of well-being around their mid-40s and men in their late 40s or early 50s
Blanchflower and Oswald controlled for the impact of education, income, marital status, race, and other demographic variables and so interpreted these findings as a picture of well-being over the life span when all other factors are equal except age
s the presence of a similar U-shaped curve in most countries of the world.
Brockmann (2010) analyzed 394 data on German adults and found some evidence for cohort effects (that is, Baby Boomers versus prewar cohorts) but concluded that the major factors influencing the dip at midlife were gender specific and related to midcareer reevaluations.
He argued that midlife creates many “frustrated achievers” because it is a time when people must reevaluate where they are in life, what they have or have not accomplished, and the inevitability of aging.
However, as people come to terms with these realities and adjust their aspirations, they can regain a greater sense of well-being
Studies that examined both gender and age at the same time found that older women tend to be less happy than older men (Argyle, 1999). Other research found that men’s happiness ratings showed a relatively steady increase as they aged, whereas women’s happiness ratings increased up to age 25, then showed a slight dip in happiness from age 25 to 35, followed by steadily increasing happiness ratings 
A study of peak experiences (that is, moments of great happiness) among Americans in midlife found that experiences involving interpersonal joy were reported most frequently, followed by those comprising external achievement (e.g., finishing a college degree or getting a job promotion) and personal growth.

The Middle-Aged Brain 
Some mental functions, such as reaction time and abilities to multitask and remember names do decline. However, other functions show improvement with age
These include complex reasoning skills, empathy, inductive reasoning, verbal memory, making financial decisions, and the ability to see connections or to grasp the big picture (Strauch, 2010)
. Studies suggest that the middle-aged brain may be “less quick, but more shrewd

Successful Aging and Aging Well 
Today, terms such as successful aging, aging well, and positive aging capture the idea that being older can be one of the most exciting and invigorating times of life
Other studies suggest the higher subjective well-being among older persons may include greater self-efficacy and optimism (Jopp & Rott, 2006), a higher felt sense of autonomy (Sheldon, Ryan, Deci, & Kasser, 2004), a more realistic view of the future (Lachman, Rocke, Rosnick, & Ryff, 2008), a more successful resolution of developmental life stages (Sheldon & Kasser, 2001), and a greater sense of meaning
 However, the higher levels of subjective well-being may depend on whether well-being is measured as positive affect or life satisfaction 
For example, some studies have found that satisfaction with life is higher among older persons but that happiness declines in old age
The other caveat is that older people remain relatively happy and satisfied only if they retain good health
Cultural factors significantly affect the relationship between well-being and older persons. Higher life satisfaction among older persons tends to be found only in Western industrialized countries 
. Other studies found that individuals from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe showed a large progressive decline in well-being as did those from Latin America; contrastingly, those from sub-Saharan Africa exhibited little change in their well-being with advancing age.
 There also appear to be effects that impact people who went through a similar experience at a specific point in time (i.e., “cohort effects”)
 One study found that people in the United States who were born from 1945 to 1960—the Baby Boomers—tended to have lower self-rated happiness than people born either before or after that period (Yang, 2008)
. Gender may also be important to well-being and age. Research tends to find that whereas younger and middle-age women report higher life satisfaction than men, the direction is reversed in older women who report lower life satisfaction and less happiness than older men
Finally, one study found that higher well-being for older groups compared to younger groups has dwindled in recent years and virtually disappeared by about 2013 
Some intriguing lines of research suggest why studies often find increased subjective well-being with age, at least in Western countries. One clue is that the increase in well-being is due primarily to a decrease in negative emotionality rather than to an increase in positive emotions
the positivity ratio for older persons increases because negative emotionality goes down, a phenomenon known as the “positivity effect” 
). Magai (2008) suggested that the positivity effect may be due partially to a reduction in the frequency of anger as people age
Other researchers have also investigated how emotions are processed and discovered that older persons may lead somewhat more interesting emotional lives than younger people
n, the emotions of young people are more intense because they have less practice and skill at self-regulation.
It seems that older people may be better able to regulate their emotions (Kryla-Lighthall, 2009), score higher on measures of emotional intelligence (see Scheibe & Carstensen, 2010), have a greater appreciation for the emotional aspects of life, and thrive with more emotional complexity than younger people.
Although older persons may react to their emotions with less intensity, studies have found that when their emotions are aroused, they feel with just as much intensity as their younger counterparts
The greater ability of older persons to control their emotional responses appears to be due to better skills at antecedent-focused emotional regulation
Older persons may also be less prone to one type of positive illusion (see Chapter 3). In this case, a study looked at temporal realism or the ability of people to accurately recall their well-being in the past and to predict their future well-being
They found that older persons showed more temporal realism—were more accurate—than younger persons
In contrast to many studies on positive illusions, it also found that greater temporal realism was associated with more adaptive functioning at all ages.
It seems that greater complexity of emotionality involves both increased range and types of emotions and more overlap among emotions, especially positive and negative emotions. 
. Older people may experience greater nuanced and poignant blends of positive and emotional emotions, as Maslow (1996) suggested. The higher well-being of many older persons may also be due to their increased feelings of connectedness to others and greater focus on the present moment
One study discovered that older persons have a greater sense of autonomy even when performing social or civic duties
in Hong Kong with important cross-cultural implications indicated that persons age 60 and older tended to withdraw from generativity if they felt a lack of perceived respect from younger generations
Brandtstädter (2002) found that people in older age groups report a greater sense of well-being when they downgrade the importance of earlier goals, give up some need for instrumental control, and use other accommodative strategies. 
 Researchers found that higher congruence was related to better subjective reports of health and economic security, which was ultimately tied to higher self-reported happiness.
Paul Baltes (1993) proposed a model of adaptation to aging based on how people adapt to difficult circumstances. Baltes called his model selective optimization with compensation.
He argued that optimal adjustment to aging was accomplished by accepting that certain capacities decline with age and finding ways to compensate for those inevitable losses.
. By such self-acceptance, one can retain optimum enjoyment from activities that give a sense of satisfaction
Carstensen began by noting that older people often regularly bypass opportunities for social contact yet report high levels of subjective well-being.
Carstensen’s answer involves her theory of socioemotional selectivity.
It states that basic psychological goals, such as the development of a positive self-concept or the regulation of emotion, remain throughout the life span, but their salience changes depending on one’s place in the life cycle
Specifically, she contended that the drives to seek out information and to develop a positive self-concept are most important during adolescence and become less important with age. In contrast, the drive for emotional regulation is less important during adolescence and then rises in significance with advancing age—until in old age it becomes dominant. 
Carstensen (1995) further observed that as people enter old age, there are fewer and fewer people who can provide novel and interesting information that seems relevant, and therefore, people are “less motivated to engage in emotionally meaningless (but perhaps otherwise functional) social contacts, and will make social choices based on the potential for emotional rewards
For this reason, satisfaction with social relationships is both higher and more important for older persons than their younger counterparts 
This process, however, is more akin to social selection than to social withdrawal
y, the value-as-moderator model of subjective well-being proposed by Oishi, Diener, Suh, and Lucas (1999) predicts that shifting values across the life span predict shifts in how well-being is calculated based on those values
With advances in medicine and more emphasis on fitness, it is possible that physically active older persons may eventually turn out to be among the happiest, most satisfied of all age groups.

Different Paths to Maturity: Individual Differences in Life Span Development 
. Helson and Srivastava examined four criteria of maturity: competence, wisdom, ego development, and generativity
y. They discovered three relatively distinct paths to positive adult development the women had followed throughout life:
 Achievers, Conservers, and Seekers.
A fourth group, the Depleted, had a pattern of unresolved emotional difficulties in their lives. 
Achievers tended to be highly achievement motivated, competent, career oriented, and ambitious;
Conservers tended to also be competent but somewhat conventional, emotionally reserved, and less open to change
. Seekers were open to new experiences, continued to question and challenge themselves throughout life, and valued personal growth over career success; they scored highest on measures of wisdom and ego development.
Achievers had the most integrated sense of self-identity
Conservers were comfortable with their identity but had accepted the self-identity others and society had expected of them;
d Seekers had not accepted conventional definitions of who they should be, and, in fact, some had still been searching for a stable self identity in their early 40s.
. Over the course of their lives, Achievers had tried to maximize their positive emotions while minimizing their negative feelings
Conservers had adopted a strategy of dampening their emotions so that both positive and negative feelings were kept in check,
 Seekers had amplified their emotions so that both positive and negative feelings were experienced more deeply
 Labouvie-Vief and Medler assumed that people regulate their emotions by using primarily two strategies.
The first is affect optimization or attempts to maximize positive emotions and dampen negative emotions.
The second is affect complexity or attempts to coordinate positive and negative emotions into cognitive-emotional schemas (i.e., organizational structures) that are both flexible and integrated
They found four groups that each used a different emotional regulation style
first was the Integrated group, which emphasized positive emotions and emotional complexity
 However, people in this group had only moderately high levels of self-complexity, and the use of certain defense mechanisms seemed to indicate some distortion of reality in order to maintain their positive emotions
 Second was the Defended group who also emphasized positive emotions but scored low on affect complexity and had a somewhat underdeveloped sense of self
This group seemed to use stronger defense mechanisms to maintain positive emotions
 A third group was labeled Complex because the people tended to have only moderate levels of positive emotions but high levels of emotional complexity (i.e., blended patterns of both positive and negative emotions) and a highly complex sense of self
The lower scores for defensiveness in the group appeared to indicate greater openness to experiences, even if experiences involved negative emotions
Last, the Dysregulated group scored low on both positive emotions and emotional complexity and were clearly having emotional difficulties
In terms of age differences, the younger group (15–29 years old) had the smallest percentage of Integrated members and the older group (60–80 years old) tended to use defense mechanisms more than the other age groups to maintain their positive emotionality and subjective wellbeing.

Narrative Approaches to the Life Span: Telling Stories to Make Sense of Our Lives 
Finally, note that the stories are not simply objective accounts of absolutely everything that happened at the time, as in a movie of the event. Rather, most stories are creative constructions from the actual events; we take bits and pieces of the events and from those pieces build a coherent narrative.
This last quality, the creative construction, is why life stories are important to our sense of well-being
Two of the major functions for our personal stories or life narratives are to aid in the creation of a self-identity or sense of self and to help create a sense of meaning
the search for meaning is often a search for a narrative that makes sense, gives us hope, and enlivens us.
Among adolescents and young adults, more sophisticated life meanings have been associated with more mature identity status (McLean & Pratt, 2006) and greater well-being (Waters & Fivush, 2014).

Themes in Life Stories 
Jennifer Pals, Kate McLean, and colleagues conducted considerable research on the relationship between life stories and personal well-being. Their analyses revealed two types of narrative processing
. One path they term is coherent positive resolution, which involves the creation of a narrative about a difficult event that has a positive ending and conveys a sense of emotional resolution and closure.
The other path they term exploratory narrative processing,which involves a willingness to fully understand a difficult situation and to analyze it with openness and full recognition of the negative emotional impact the event had on one’s life.
This process leads to greater depth and more complexity to a person’s understanding of life events
Research has found that high coherent positive narratives are often associated with building positive relationships and high scores on subjective well-being.
High exploratory narratives, on the other hand, are associated with personal growth and high scores on maturity, wisdom, and ego development.
That is, people tell positive or happy stories to support and nurture interpersonal relationships, but they tell stories about difficult or negative events to help understand life in a more complex and compelling way
By looking at both high and low styles of coherent positive and exploratory processing it is possible to create a 2 × 2 matrix of life narrative styles
Therefore, it is possible to look at narratives that display transformation processing or both high coherent positive and high exploratory processing
 g. These narratives contain both high positive resolution and high processing of negative emotions; these tend to be more consistently associated with indices of greater well-being.
 Pals suggested that positive adaptation to difficult life events may be a two-step process
: First explore the meaning and emotional impact of the event, 
second construct a coherent and positive resolution
Laura King also explored the ways in which narratives may impact wellbeing. In studies of how people adjust to important life transitions, she and her colleagues found two processes that may be important
When life transitions are required, a person must be able to relinquish old goals that are no longer possible and embrace potential second chances in life
That is, people must be able to let go of both the old goals and the old self and then work to create new goals or second chances and new found selves.
A final comment about narratives involves the cultural aspect of life stories. Studies have found that the stories we choose to create reflect the values 405 and perspectives of our particular culture 
. For instance, stories by native Chinese tend to be less focused on the self and more focused on both morality and connectedness to family than are stories by Americans
 a frequent theme in American stories involves a redemptive sequence;that is, a difficult or challenging experience is transformed by the person’s own active intervention, creating a change in the self that becomes the focal point of the story. 
In a later study, narratives of self redemption predicted behavioral change and improved health among individuals recovering from alcohol addiction.
The idea that telling stories about our lives can be adaptive is the core assumption of reminiscence therapy.
A study looking at reminiscence therapy inspired by positive psychology found increased life satisfaction and well-being among older adults after eight sessions
However, the type of reminiscence may be important to outcomes. In one study, successful aging was associated only with narratives that integrated aspects of a person’s life or that helped the person reach goals
It is also possible that some narrative themes are universal and crosscultural. For example, comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell (1949) described what he called the “myth of the hero.” 
The impact of cultural narrative on subjective well-being can also be seen with goal pursuits
Reaching these milestones at the correct times has an impact partially because these accomplishments help create a positive identity in a person’s life narrative that says, “I’ve been a success in life.”
This same relationship can be found in the idea of age identity. Our age identity is how old we feel, rather than our chronological age
. One study that examined adults in the United States and Germany found that feeling younger than one’s actual age was associated with greater subjective well-being
Another study found that feeling younger than one’s actual age was associated with better cognitive abilities 10 years later

Adjusting To Difficult Life Events 
studies have found that up to 60% of adults have faced a major crisis or trauma at some point in their lives
Differing nomenclature in research on positive adaptation to crisis or trauma presents a challenge. Here we adopt the terminology suggested by Christopher Davis and Susan Nolen-Hoeksema 
In their view, the term benefit finding describes common but potentially transient adjustments to adversity.
often take the form of positive interpretations of setbacks that place the event in a different light, that is, proverbially seeing the glass as half full rather than half empty.
In contrast, posttraumatic growth refers to significant changes in life goals and life commitments that require major alterations in one’s sense of identity or life narrative
Resilience is the familiar descriptor for “a broad array of abilities for constructively and positively adapting to risk, adversity, or some monumental negative event”
 Resilience is found when a person responds favorably to a significant event that would otherwise produce major decreases in well-being. 
 Note however that some studies conceptualize resilience mainly as a protective mechanism, similar to psychological immunity, that is, a mechanism that buffers against future challenges 

Resilience in Children 
Indeed, surprisingly some children who grow up in highly dysfunctional families emerge well-adjusted as adults
 These studies consistently indicate that some children thrive despite difficult backgrounds that include chronic poverty, parental neglect, parental psychopathology, family abuse, or living in the midst of war
 about 10% of the children were well-adjusted despite the presence of bizarre family environments.
Werner found that approximately one third of the children from difficult backgrounds emerged as competent and caring adults
Werner (1995) described a core group of characteristics typical of resilient children across various studies.
First, they were able to find a nurturing surrogate parent. It appears that an ability to emotionally detach from a disturbed parent was only the first step.
such children succeeded in forming a close relationship with at least one teacher who served as a role model.
 In seeming contradiction to classic attachment theory, these children thrived because they could detach themselves emotionally from their disturbed parents
. Second, the children had good social and communication skills and at least one close friend. They also had a desire to help and provide nurturance to other people and a capacity for empathy and altruism
 Third, resilient children had creative outlets, activities, or hobbies on which they could focus when life became even more difficult than usual
. Competence with this activity also imparted a sense of pride and mastery
. Fourth, these children were relatively optimistic and seemed to have an internal locus of control and a positive self-concept. 
Resilient children also developed a style of coping that combined autonomy with the ability to ask for help when necessary
Last, families that held religious beliefs providing meaning in difficult times were also common for resilient children.
Werner (1995) suggested that family factors that promote resiliency appeared to be different for boys and girls.
For resilient boys, the important factors were a household with good structure and rules, a male role model, and encouragement of emotional expressiveness.
. Resilient girls seemed to need homes that emphasized risk-taking and independence, as well as provided reliable support from an older female. 
Werner found that a particularly positive influence on girls was a mother who was steadily employed
She also noted that these “protective buffers” were found in resilient children regardless of differences in ethnicity, social class, and geographic location.
Among the more intriguing conclusions of these studies is that resilient children are actively involved in creating or finding environments and people who will be supportive and reinforce their competencies.

New Perspectives on Resilient Children
 Indeed, researchers today view family factors, such as having a good relationship with at least one parent or supportive relationships with competent siblings, as the most important influence on children’s adjustment. 
Besides family factors, the role of supportive communities may be next in importance for children.
Community factors that help foster adjustment include positive relationships with peers, friends, or a trusted teacher; participation in positive social or religious organizations; and a sense of social cohesion or community involvement in the child’s neighborhood
 personality factors of children now take a secondary role to family and community factors
In addition to the personality factors listed earlier, research has suggested that the following are also important: an ability to inhibit unwanted behavior and regulate emotions, high emotional intelligence, high self-efficacy and persistence, and insight into the complexities of diverse situations and behaviors

Emerging Adulthood
 Nevertheless, Erikson did not feel it necessary to posit a separate stage between adolescence and early adulthood because the two were temporally linked so closely for most people at the time
However, beginning with a seminal paper by Jeffrey Arnett (2000), a growing number of researchers have proposed the existence of a new stage of human development, termed that of “emerging adulthood.”
” In Arnett’s view, significant structural economic and technological changes in life had occurred for individuals and families in recent decades; these changes gave rise to the stage of emerging adulthood
Arnett specified five features as distinct (although not unique) to emerging adulthood:
identity explorations, instability, self-focus, feeling inbetween,and possibilities or optimism
. Identity explorations relates to trying out different possibilities for one’s identity, mainly related to romantic relationships, work, and ideology
 Instability refers to the fact that upheavals in both romantic relationships and work are common during these years
. Self-focus relates to the absorption with oneself rather than with others (such as parents or commitment to a romantic partner) typical for this stage.
Feeling in-between concerns the fact that emerging adults tend to regard themselves as neither adolescents nor adults but somewhere inbetween
, possibilities or optimism relates to the fact that most emerging adults, at least in the United States, are optimistic about their futures. That is, they believe they will transition successfully into adulthood with its responsibilities and satisfactions
a study with American college students found that identity and life purpose were interrelated during emerging adulthood but that life purpose was a stronger predictor of all aspects of psychological well-being
In a study involving Swiss men aged 18 to 25 years, those experiencing identity confusion had lower psychosocial well-being, whereas those optimistically exploring many opportunities had higher psychosocial well-being
Unexpectedly, she found that when children were praised for their intelligence (e.g., “That’s great. You are so smart!”), it was more difficult for children to adapt to later difficulties.
That is, the child becomes afraid that if she or he gives a wrong answer later on, then the “intelligence” is gone and the praise will disappear with it
For Dweck, this worry creates a fixed mind-set in children and makes it more difficult for them to handle challenges in the future.
The alternative is to praise children for their efforts and for being engaged in the process of learning and discovery
 This attitude toward learning and challenges Dweck (2006) has called a growth mind-set.
Research by Dweck and her colleagues found that children with growth mind-sets are more likely to persist in difficult tasks and overcome challenges
They also found that children can be taught to use a growth mind-set by recognizing and valuing the process of transformation that occurs when a growth mind-set operates
Finally, Dweck and her colleagues found that the concepts of fixed and growth mind-sets applied equally well to adults
Those with a fixed mind-set lost interest in the problems after being informed their answers were incorrect. However, those with a growth mindset stayed involved by seeking out the correct answers; they also scored better when tested again later
Practical applications have included teaching a growth mind-set to business managers, teachers, and university students. Such workshops teach that effort put into learning helps create new brain connections


Resilience in Adulthood 
The researchers found that higher levels of resilience were found only among those who had a history of dealing with moderate adversity
, research suggests that dealing with some adversity in life helps us adjust and thrive. A review of research concluded that lower resilience was associated with either a life of no adversity or high adversity 



Cultivating Resilience in Adults
 Review of research on resilience in adulthood has found similar patterns to those with children (Greve & Staudinger, 2006), that is, a greater emphasis on family and community factors and a lesser role on individual personality factors.
Important factors in how adults deal successfully with difficulties are the supportiveness of one’s social network of family and friends, having a sense of community involvement, and social participation in religious activities
One factor relevant to positive psychology that can increase resilience is positive emotionality. 
Other factors that enhance resilience include task-or problem-focused coping, commitment to goals, humor, patience, optimism, faith, altruism (Connor & Zhang, 2006), mindfulness and self-compassion therapy (Perez-Blasco, Sales, Meléndez, & Mayordomo, 2015), and the use of mature defense mechanisms
However, trying too hard to regulate emotions is less likely to facilitate resilience (Kashdan, Breen, & Julian, 2010). Resilience requires finding that delicate balance between too much and too little emotional control.
. The researchers found that people tended to actively engage in new possibilities after adversity if they used the familiar idea that challenge can involve loss, but it can also create opportunity
The American Psychological Association cautions that resilience is not a trait (see “On the Web” below). Rather, it is a way of dealing with adversity that can be developed, and each person goes about this process in her or his own unique way
The APA suggests the following factors are important for the cultivation of resilience: 
1. Make connections with family, friends, or community. 2. Avoid seeing crises as insurmountable problems. 3. Accept that change is part of living. 4. Move toward your goals. 5. Take decisive action, use problem- and task-focused coping. 6. Look for opportunities for self-discovery. 7. Nurture a positive view of yourself. 8. Keep events in perspective. 9. Maintain a hopeful outlook. 10. Take care of yourself, attend to your needs and feelings

Posttraumatic Growth
 Occasionally, a traumatic event is such that it requires both assimilation and accommodation. The result is an adaptation that enhances flourishing and elevates a person to a higher level of psychosocial functioning and wellbeing
These types of changes are termed posttraumatic growth
Janoff-Bulman (2004) suggested that posttraumatic growth involves changes in self-understanding and one’s worldview or meaning-making
Davis and Nolen-Hoeksema (2009) contended that benefit finding and self-protective functions such as positive illusions may provide emotional relief but may not produce robust and lasting accommodations to the trauma
Such protective processes may produce “pseudo-growth” that, ironically, makes a person more vulnerable to crises.
Authentic posttraumatic growth can be seen when a person renegotiates personal goals and life priorities in important ways
This renegotiation requires significant disengagement from old activities, strivings, and core projects.
The next step is to create 416 new goals and priorities that are intrinsically motivating and personally meaningful.
Central to this understanding of posttraumatic growth is the notion that cognitive reappraisals by themselves are insufficient to indicate authentic posttraumatic growth.
In a study of posttraumatic growth of U.K. military veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder, researchers found that greater “appreciation for life” was a dominant theme; participants also reported that reaching a crisis point acted as a catalyst for seeking support and, in turn, experiencing growth.



Sense of Coherence
 Antonovsky explored people’s ability to cope well with trauma and stress. Most researchers assume that homeostasis, or a state of balanced equilibrium, is the desired or baseline state of the human organism
, Antonovsky assumes that humans are inherently active, curious, exploratory, and variety-seeking. If this is true, then people don’t really desire equilibrium but rather seek growth, development, and positive change
researchers interested in resilience and stress should adopt a salutogenic orientation that examines how to enhance an active, exploratory, and variety-seeking perspective on life.
This approach, you 417 will recall, is similar to that taken by positive psychology.
Taking this perspective as his starting point, Antonovsky developed a sense of coherence model, which he saw as a unique set of personality traits that creates an orientation to life allowing people to interpret life stressors in a positive and adaptive way, that is, as coherent and understandable despite adversity
y. He began his empirical research into the sense of coherence concept by examining the lives of people who met two criteria
 First, they had undergone a severe trauma that involved inescapable consequences for their life: namely, the death of a loved one, a severe personal disability, or financial deprivation.
The second requirement was that such a person must currently be functioning well in life. In other words, Antonovsky’s participants showed evidence of highly adaptive coping skills and competence despite experiencing severe stress and trauma. 
For Antonovsky, a sense of coherence comprises three major factors:
The first, and most important, factor he called meaningfulness, which he defined as the extent to which one’s life makes sense on an emotional level. Meaning gives a person the willingness to take up the challenges of life. It gives a person the sense that he or she is “a participant in the process shaping one’s destiny as well as one’s daily experience.” Meaningfulness gives a person the sense “that at least some of the problems and demands posed by living are worth investing energy in, are worthy of commitment and engagement” (Antonovsky, 1979, p. 128). Notably, this factor doesn’t imply that when life makes sense, we will always be happy. Instead, a life that is meaningfu
The second most important factor in a sense of coherence is comprehensibility. This is the extent to which life events appear ordered, consistent, structured, and clear; life does not appear to be chaotic and random. One who scores high on comprehensibility “expects that the stimuli he or she will encounter in the future will be predictable or, at the very least, when they do come as surprises, that they will be ordered and explainable”
The third factor is manageability. This is the belief that our personal resources and coping skills are adequate to meet the demands of the tasks that confront us. It is “the extent to which one perceives that resources are at one’s disposal which are adequate to meet the demands posed by the stimuli that bombard one” (Antonovsky, 1987, p. 17). In essence, this factor means a sense of control derived from confidence in one’s coping skills.
. Finally, a high sense of coherence has been found to be a stable trait over the middle years of adulthood

Master Resilience Training 
The program teaches resilience skills through three modules: building mental toughness, building character strengths, and building strong relationships.
Mental toughness skills are taught by using techniques from learned optimism training as well as rational emotive and cognitive therapies. These focus primarily on changing pessimistic and catastrophic thoughts into more rational and adaptable ones
Character strengths are taught by using the VIA Survey of Character to pinpoint individual signature strengths, especially those that help overcome challenges
The strong relationships module teaches Carol Dweck’s ideas on growth mind-set (see the earlier discussion), Shelly Gable’s research on active constructive communication (see Chapter 5), and assertiveness training to enhance both professional and personal relationships. 

Healthy and Adaptive Defense Mechanisms
 He felt that mental health could not be defined by an average or by reference to “normal” behavior.
Vaillant also rejected the criterion of absence of psychological conflict because all the men in the 421 Grant and Glueck study had at times reacted childishly to stressors or been despondent, anxious, or overly temperamental.
Vaillant (2000) found that the type of defense mechanisms used by a young person could predict well-being over 20 years later
He classified defense mechanisms on a continuum from extreme to mild, based on the degree of unconsciousness and involuntariness involved
psychotic, immature, neurotic, and mature or adaptive styles
. Psychotic defense mechanisms were clearly unhealthy and involved severe distortions of reality in an attempt to avoid anxiety (e.g., delusional projection, psychotic denial). Immature defense mechanisms were often used by adolescents and persons with severe depression (e.g., projection, hypochondriasis, passive-aggression, and acting out). 
By contrast, Vaillant saw neurotic defense mechanisms as average or “normal” styles that most people use to cope with anxiety, threat, and conflict (e.g., repression, intellectualization, reaction formation, displacement/conversion, and neurotic denial/dissociation)
, the mature or adaptive defense mechanisms Vaillant identified were altruism, anticipation, humor, sublimation, and suppression. These defense mechanisms deal with anxiety by attempting to maximize gratification but at the same time allow awareness of underlying feelings, impulses, ideas, and consequences of behavior.
Interestingly, Vaillant also found that self-perception of happiness was not always associated with better adjustment. Indeed, those in the mature category did not always score higher than others on self-reported measures of happiness

<h2>The Flyest Nihlest - My Final Script For A Screenwriting Class I Took</h2>
<p>
	            The Flyest Nihilist

(Curtains rise as we see the aspiring young journalist, Frederick Neatche, shaking hands while laughing hysterically with his boss, William Ritz. Both men are having a glass of whiskey in Ritz’s office on a pleasant afternoon) 

					        Mr. Ritz
And that's when I said, that's MY wife!! 

					       Frederick
				   (Spits out the whiskey, laughing)
Mr. Ritz! You devious sly dog! How did you get away with it?

					        Mr. Ritz
That's the thing, I didn't!!

	(Both men are laughing extremely hard now. They’re pounding the table and wiping their eyes. Mr. Ritz clears his throat a bit while Frederick is still laughing.)

Also you’re fired Fred. 

					      Frederick 
				         (laughing intensively)
Ohhh what another beautiful joke Mr Ritz.!They should really put you up on the RITZ for that one..HUH?!	

					        Mr. Ritz
Fred, seriously, you’re fired. You can stop kissing my ass, you’re not getting the September raise. That’s going to Mark. 

					       Frederick 
				  (Starts to sit up and fix his suit)
Fired?? September raise?? Me?? Whattt?? Mr. Ritz I think you got your sentence wrong. What I think you meant to say was, ‘Mark YOU’RE getting fired and congratulations Fred! You’re getting a fat-ass promotion!’

					        Mr. Ritz
Christ Fred, I didn’t want to rip this band aid off, but I guess I have too. (Stands up, and downs his whiskey)
Your stories suck. Marks don’t. Your stories bore me and make me wish I could erase them from my brain. Mark’s stories captivate me and make me keep asking for more. Occasionally I’ll use your stories to help keep my fires alive in my fireplace or I’ll use them to wipe my ass. Mark’s stories I proudly show to my colleagues from Harvard and Oxford when I host my cocktail parties. You see what I’m getting at? You see why I’m firing you? You embody every little thing that’s wrong with a journalist, I can’t have that here Fred I’m sorry but I hope you understand. 

						Fred
					         (Silence)
Do you actually use my articles as toilet paper? 

					          Mr. Ritz
Did you just hear any of what I said just now? 

						Fred
About how I suck? Yeah.

					         Mr. Ritz
Well?

						Fred
Well what?

					        Mr. Ritz
Well are you going to leave my office?!

						Fred
				       (Sighing loudly getting up)
I mean I suppose so. I guess I’ll have to start my life as a new man in the workforce again. 

(Mr. Ritz has his arm around Fred, walking him to the door)

						Mr. Ritz
Mhm

						Fred
I’ll have to find ways to make ends meet somehow. I can barely afford my apartment. 

						Mr. Ritz
Ouch

						Fred 
I started developing these rashes after I hooked up with this woman off the street.

						Mr. Ritz
Damn, that’s crazy

						   Fred
I’m even beginning to question my religion! Like is God even alive? Does he actually care for us?!

						Mr. Ritz
What a tragedy. Well it seems we’re at the end of your stop. I honestly do hope for the best for you, Frederick. You’ll find your calling kid I promise, but...journalism just isn’t it. Now just pack up your belongings and be out of here by 3:30. Okay? 

						Fred
Yeah..uh yeah of course, you got it Mr. Ritz. 

					         Mr. Ritz
					     (Opens door)
All right, pal. Now you ta-OH hey! Mark! Mark!! Yeah you Mark, you’re the only Mark that works here! Get in here you rat bastard. I got a surprise for you!

					       Blackout
(We see Frederick with a box full of his belongings walking around soldumenly around the entrance of his office. His shoulders are slumped and he’s sighing constantly) 

						Fred
Oh me oh my how my life is changing rapidly. I recently just got fired. I can’t afford this week's rent so I guess I’m moving back in with my parents. My rash is getting WORSE (begins to violently scratch all over). I would ask for you to give me a sign God or Vishnu or whoever the hell is up there! But I don’t know if you guys even exist anymore!! How will I be able to pick myself up from this? How will I ever find my calling? C’mon Fred think...you always come up with a solution most of the time. Think think think, I must find my calling in this bleak world!
(Dumbs all of his belongings on the street and sits on his coat holding out his box) 
OH PLEASE HELP OH PLEASE! I'M A TRIFLING CHILD WHO HAS NOTHING IN LIFE! WON’T ANYONE SPARE SOME CHANGE?!!

						Golfer (offstage)
THREE THOUSAND AND SIXTY FOUR!!!

(A golf ball can be seen flying out from stage left, landing inside Fred’s box)
						Fred
WATCH IT MAN! I’M SEARCHING FOR MY CALLING! 

						Golfer
WHOOPS! THREE THOUSAND AND SIXTY FIIIIVEEE! 


(Another golf ball is launched from stage left, this time hitting Fred in the head. Fred Falls over, head in box)
		
						    Fred
(Big gasp for air as Fred takes his head out of the box cursing in German. Fred now has a German accent)
My goodness the people here are unbelievable! Wait where am I? Better question, WHO am I? There has to be something here that’ll tell me. (Begins rummaging through his belongings that he dumped. Fred then comes across his desk sign and examines it.) Frederick...Neatche? Frederick...Neatche… Oh mein Gott it’s me!! Friedrich Nietzsche!! I’m reborn as the Übermensch!! (Begins to get up and look around) If I’m now the Übermensch, my accomplishments must've left me in the most prestigious of bodies! (Looks in the window) OH MEIN! My body has transformed into the most prepubescent of bodies! My mustache, it’s been massacred! (Stands up straight and has his chin raised high) No need to worry though! I will use this body to my advantage. I'll begin to challenge society once again with my magnificent intelligence and my cunning ability to philosophize one's mind! The world will once again learn to love my ideas and it’ll slowly but surely begin to shape a new, greater society for all! I need something to ignite my journey however. (Fred picks up his wallet off the ground and pulls out his license) Ah wunderbar! My journey will start at 682 Lockwood Avenue. I mustn’t keep my colleagues waiting, we must quickly get to work if we’re off to shape society!

 Scene 2
(Lights shine on a disorganized but comfortable apartment. There is a black couch stage left with a TV in front of it. Fred’s neighbor Paul Steinberg. Paul is dressed in a grocery store uniform with a name tag. He is laying on the couch in the laziest of positions watching Jeopardy!. )

					Alex Trebek 
Who was the famous German philosopher whose goal was to be the Ubersmencth, failed at forming a commune, and Uttered the statement “God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him”?

					Paul
Augustus Gloop?

				          Contestant 
Who is...Friedrick Nietzche?
            (Fred burst through the apartment door)
				          Alex Trebek
Correct! 

					Paul
			         (Grumpy but whiney to himself)
Shut up. 

					Fred
Greetings my distinguished colleagues! I have returned! 


					Paul
				(Falling off the couch)
Jesus Christ man! I don’t care where you came from but, can a simple man just watch a game of goodman Jeopardy. Please! (Gets up off the floor) Anyway, who the hell are you?


					Fred
Ah gutentag! I am Frederick Nietzche.

					Paul
Wait. Like the dude from Jeopardy?

					Fred
No it’s GER-Ma-Ney! Close though, I appreciate the effort. (Looking around) Now could you make like a good little dachshund and fetch me the rest of my colleagues? I suppose they didn’t hear my grand entrance!

					Paul
I’m the only one that lives here, man.  

					Fred
				       (Laughing)
Aw the little dachshund has jokes! Ah how cute, but seriously where are my colleagues. I’m sure they want to throw a party before we begin our journey! No worries I’ll find them!

(Fred begins to walk around Paul's apartment)
	(said overlapping each other)

	Fred								Paul			
Yoo-hoo my little colleagues!						Dude

Come out wherever you are!						Cut it out man

I’ll find youuuuu!!					     	          Hey, that's my room!!

					Paul
				    (grabbing Fred)
That's enough! Look man I don’t know where your so-called colleagues are, but they ain’t here! So can you please leave man. (Defeated) I just want to win the final Jeopardy.

					Fred
			  (says to himself in a thinking pose)
It appears that none of my colleagues are here? Does this mean an end to my journey? Nien! I mustn't give up now, I must try one more solution! 
			(looks at Paul, calling him like a dog)
Excuse me! Daschund! I have one more question! This is 682 Lockwood Avenue, no?


(Fred pulls out his license and hands it to Paul)
	
		     Paul	
Oh. Nah man this is actually 681 Lockwood Avenue, you’re actually just the next door down. (Hands license back) Also could you stop calling me a dachshund? I get it your German and everything, but it’s like, weird. I have a name by the way, it’s Paul. 

					     Fred
(Drops license, jaw dropped) W-what did you say your name was again dachshund? 

					      Paul
C’mon man I just told you it’s Paul

					     Fred
(Runs over to Paul, putting his hands on his face) Oh Paul I knew it was you! How could I be such a fool! Yes I see it now! Those young eyes that desire to see change in this world. Your perfectly slicked back hair that's slick like your wit and knowledge. I cannot believe what I’m seeing but my colleague and best friend Paul Ree has been reborn just like me!! (Hugs Paul)

					Paul
My last name is Steinburg 
			
					Fred
Huh? (breaks hug)

					Paul
My last name isn’t Ree it’s Steinburg. See? 
(shows Fred his nametag)


					Fred
(Examines nametag, looks at paul, back at nametag then lets out a hardy laugh and pats Paul on the back)
 Ah I see your still up to your old pranks that you would pull in our past lives my friend! I applaud you, you got me really good this time. Pretending to live a subpar human lifestyle is the best one yet!

					Paul
This is what my life is like normally. 

					Fred 
(On the ground giggling) 
Stop it! Stop it! This is too much!! (stands up) Ah anyway, Paul it was amazing seeing you again my friend. You better be ready tomorrow morning though. At the crack of dawn we’ll begin our journey to shape society once again! As for now gute nacht! 
      (begins to leave Paul’s apartment)


					Paul
Okay Im gonna go out on a limb and guess that means goodnight. In case it does, your apartment just got evicted literally an hour ago. 

					Fred
Evicted meaning...I’m homeless?

					Paul
Basically 

					Fred
(Slams Paul door shut) WUNDERBAR! We’ll begin right now!

					Paul
Great

					Fred
This is more than great Paul. This is one of the first steps in reconstructing our commune for society!

					Paul
Hold on, didn’t your commune originally fail? 

					Fred
Yes it did, but we’ve been reborn. This is our second chance at life to learn from our mistakes and grow! Just think of us living again in Sweden in our commune full of Übermensch, working twice as diligently as we once did. 

					Paul 
Wait did you say we would live in Sweden?

Fred
Yes Paul, don’t you remember?

Paul
(Standing up a bit more straight)
Oh yeah totally! Silly me how could I forget Sweden! I loved Sweden so much! When are we going back to Sweden? Can we go back now, I really want to go. 	

Fred
Calm yourself Paul, you must save your enthusiasm for when we officially begin. There are still some steps we need to get out of the way. 

Paul
Oh yeah, I totally forgot. Could you refresh my mind um Fred?	

					Fred
Gladly! First we must denounce our citizenship. I’ll go first, (Clears his throat) I DECLARE MYSELF NO LONGER A CITIZEN OF PRUSSIA.

        (Bangs are heard as residents are hitting the floors due to Fred yelling)
					Resident
Quiet down there! I’m watching my IPad! 	

					Paul 
Okay two things Fred. 1 Prussia is no longer a state, sorry you had to find out like this. 2 We’re not in Germany.

					Fred
What? Where are we?

					Paul
Chicago

					Fred
Blegh, it sounds hideous

					Paul
I mean yeah, you’re not wrong

					Fred
(Clears his throat again) 
I DECLARE MYSELF NO LONGER A CITIZEN OF CHICAGO 

				(Bangs can be heard again)
					Resident 2
Good! Get outta here! 

					Fred
Now Paul it’s your turn! 

					Paul
Do I really have to?

					Fred 
Yes Paul! These steps are important! 

				           Paul
But I’m a Bears fan. 

					Fred
Yes internally channel the strength of a bear and use it to denounce your citizenship Paul!  

					Paul
Cool not what I meant at all but whatever. Please forgive me Coach Ditka, I declare myself no longer a citizen of Chicago. Woohoo. 

					Fred
Louder Paul louder! Take pride in those words! 

					Paul
But the Bears man

					Fred
Will you shut it about bears! 

					Paul
I DECLARE MYSELF NO LONGER A CITIZEN OF CHICAGO!
		(The banging comes back from the residents but this time it’s a bit longer)


					Fred 
You hear that Paul? That’s the sounds of our plans coming together! 

					Paul 
I better lock my door

					Fred 
Not now, we must move on to step 2! Let’s join the war! 

					Paul
How does this relate to the commune exactly?

					    Fred
It doesn’t! But we must recreate the steps I did in my previous life in order to be the perfect Ubsermench. Like me! (Pulls out a gun) Now where's the nearest war in Chicago! 

(Nietzsche and Paul Freeze as two writers enter stage right holding stacks of papers and writing on them as they walk out.)
					Writer 1
Woah woah woah! We can’t have Nietzsche use a freaking gun!

					Writer 2 
But he went to war. 

					Writer 1
Jesus, yeah I know! This is going to leave a big plothole though. Like, where did he even get a gun in the first place?

Writer 2
Bought it. 

Writer 1
Where?

Writer 2
          (nonchalantly)
Okay he found it 

Writer 1
WHERE??!


Writer 2
I don’t know off the street? It’s in Chicago, man they probably have like vending machines for guns there

 Writer 1
Just shut up and let’s be serious about this 

					Writer 2
Okay fine, have fun making a boring show.
(The writers leave)

					Fred
Congratulations Paul! We completed the one and only step needed for our glorious formation of our commune! (Tearing up) I’m so proud of you my friend! 

					Paul
Yeah whooo mazel tov am I right. Now let’s get going to Sweden. I'll start packing!

					Fred
Not yet! We may have completed all of the steps, but we still need one more piece for our journey. Tell me, how close is Rome from your house?

					Paul
Uhhh like 10 minutes from here? 

					Fred
Perfect! We’ll head to Rome tomorrow morning! As for now gute natch my good friend. I’m glad you’re back, I’ve got a good feeling about this Paul. 

		(Fred hugs Paul goodnight and immediately falls asleep on Paul’s couch. Paul looks over at Fred on his couch and sighs loudly going over to the light switch)

					Paul
				(chuckling to himself)
Fucking Nietzsche man, Sweden better be worth it. 
		(Turns out the light, resulting in a blackout as scenes end)


Scene 3 

(Lights shine on a filled Italian themed restaurant named Slice of Rome. There is a  huge painting of the Roman Colosseum front and center on the wall of the restaurant as we see Fred and Paul sitting in front of it. Paul is looking through a menu calmly as Nietszche is looking around with a confused expression on his face)

Fred
Paul this isn’t Rome but merely a distasteful representation of Rome! You’re jeopardizing our mission Paul I cannot allow this! (Starts to leave)

				           Paul
		      (Grabs Fred and shows him the front of the menu)
Do you know why this place is called Slice of Rome? It’s because we’re LITERALLY sitting in an actual little slice of Rome. These chairs are the same chairs Julius Caesar sat in before getting stabbed by his friends. We’re in Rome Fred! Now order a Caesar Salad in his respects, our waiter is coming.

					Fred
I’m starting not to appreciate your jokes anymore Paul! I’m serious, we must travel to Rome in order to meet our final person! 
		
					Paul
They can wait, we’ll get them a to-go box.

					Fred
No Paul! We have to go see- 

					Lou
				(In a russian accent)
Good morning gentlemen. My name is Lou and I’ll be your server today!

					Fred
				(Jumps out of his seat)
Lou it’s you! I can recognize that accent from anywhere!

					Paul
Who?

					Fred
Lou!

					Lou
Me?

					Fred
Yes you! Lou it’s us, Frederick Nietzsche and Paul Ree, we’ve been reborn! 

Paul
Sup
					
					Lou
				(Drops notepad and pen)
Frederick? Paul? I can’t believe it, I knew this day would come! Once I was reborn that fateful night  I knew that meant one day that we would all cross paths again in our new lives.
(Beat)
Wait a minute, how do I know you’re the REAL Frederick and Paul? You two dont look like Ubermensch.

					Paul
How do we know you’re the REAL Lou?? 
(To Nietzsche)
Who’s Lou again?

					Fred
The third piece we need for our commune! Surely you remember the commune we once had together in our past lives! 

					Lou
Oh yes Fred I remember the commune. I remember how it failed! You really think talking about that disaster is going to convince me that you’re Nietzsche? That’s Nietzsche 101! All you two are doing are embarrassing yourselves and I won’t be included. 
(Picks up notepad and pen) 
Now what do you guys want to order. 

Paul
I’ll get some water with the gabagoo- 

					Fred
Silence! Lou I promise you it’s us! Look where we are, we’re in Rome! Where we all first met way back in 1882, where we first started to discuss our plans to build and shape our academic commune for society full of little Ubermensch! 

Lou 
And 120 years later, we all cross paths again...in Rome...discussing the commune. 

Paul
Eerie, now about that gabagool.


Lou 
It all makes sense.. .This is my calling! No our calling to form a better world for all!

					Fred
Yes Lou now you see it! 

					Paul
I guess I shouldn’t hold my breath on our food

Lou
			(Begins untying her apron with excitement)
Ah, I knew this day would come, but I didn’t expect it to happen this quickly! I finally get to fulfill my purpose that I was given in this new world! I felt so lost at times before you two that I began to submerge myself in the basic norms of this society. But now, I’m saved! 
(throws her apron and walks to the kitchen which is off stage right)
HA I quit!! Do you hear me, Chef Yevoli? I quit! My colleagues Frederick  Nietzsche and Paul Ree (turns her and looks at Paul and Fred. Does an over exaggerated flitours wink to Paul) have returned to save me like I told you they would! Now we’re off to shape society whilst you sit there and cook stupid American burgers! 

				\	Chef Yevoli 
 					(Offstage)
Sounds great Lou! Send me a fucking post card while yer at it! (Laughs)

(Lou begins breathing heavily with anger as she rolls up her sleeves and begins to stomp towards stage right, but Fred and Paul come and grab both of her arms pulling her back)

					
 					Paul
Woah there red army, he ain’t worth it

					Fred
		(Has his arm around Lou walking towards the exit of the restaurant. Paul follows slowly behind, taking people's plates filled with food as they pass a table)
Yes Paul is right. Let’s just go home for now and discuss what our next course of action is for the reconstruction of our commune. We don’t want any non ubermensch hearing our plans and try to copy our most wundabar society, now do we? 
(beat)
I’ll make us all some tea when we get back! 

					Lou 
			(a bit exhausted from the adrenaline draining)
I suppose you’re right Fred, Thank you. I’m so grateful that you two are back in my life, I now know that I have people that actually care for me in this life. 
(Kisses Fred’s check) 
Hey what happened to your mustache? 

					   Fred
	(Opens the restaurant's door and pushes Lou out. Fred closes the door and turns around with a look of disgust at Paul.) 
You better stop your mischievous deeds you little snake! 

					Paul 
			(with a bunch of plates in his hands)
Dude you should’ve told me that way sooner. I’ve got so many plates on my hands I don't know if I can put them down.

					Fred
				(smacks Paul on the head)
Im talk-

					Paul
(Fred loses balance after the smack and drops all the plates, all of them crashing one by one) 
uh ...Sorry

					Fred
Are you done?


					Paul 
Dude it was the plates not me I swear

					Fred 
Whatever, just stay away from Lou. I saw the way she looked at you with her beautiful eyes and her soft silky smile. 

					Paul
Woah Nietzsche do you have a crush? 

					Fred
				(Red with embarrassment)
NO! Just don’t try anything romantic with her like you did all the time in your past life. I was given another life for a purpose. 

					Paul
				(hands up sarcastically)
Yeah you got it man. Won’t lay a finger or breath on her.

					Fred
Good. Now let's go. (Opens the door with power and Paul leaves with Nietzsche following behind him, off stage) Oh Lou my dearest Lou! You’ve taken a mighty tumble, now how did that happen?
				          Blackout

Scene 4 

(Lights shine on Paul’s apartment. Fred is center stage right while Lou and Paul sit center stage left. They are seated very far from each other. Fred is standing next to a giant white board that has written on it “Names for Commune”) 

					Fred
First matter of business. I would like to thank both of you for sticking by me once again. Paul, while you may have gotten on my nerves a couple times, you’ve helped me traverse through this new world and I can’t thank you enough. Lou, seeing how you too are also reborn like Paul and I, has given me an extreme amount of confidence in our future together (winks at Lou awkwardly) 

 					Lou
	(Looks at Nietzche awkwardly and then looks at Paul with a ‘what the hell?’ look.)

					Paul
(In return shrugs his shoulder playfully and then looks at Nietzche with an overexaggerated Kill the lights' motion)

					Fred
				    (stifled cough)
Right, let’s get serious. Over the course of my rebirth, there have been multiple questions that have been entrapped in my brain. Were we unprepared before we constructed our commune? No, that’s impossible! We’re ubermensch! Did we choose the wrong time to go? Wrong again! Sweden is always beautiful! Did we not have enough people? Maybe! Three is not a high number! 
(Beat)
Regardless of these questions, there has been one dominant question that has been leeching on to me. How could our commune easily fail? And then my friends, like an angel's kiss, it came to me! We didn’t have, as people say nowadays, a triumphant name for our commune! 

					Lou
Oh  Nietzsche you’re a  genius! Without a oh, how do you say it? trumpet?

					Fred
Triumphant? 

					Lou
Yes! Without a triumphant name, how on earth were we supposed to alert the other ubermensch of our glorious commune back then! We must have made ourselves look like a pair of just regular people back then huh?! 

(Fred and Lou then laugh hysterically with each other. Paul sitting with his arms crossed looks at Fred and Lou. Paul then leans over as far as he can, whispering to Lou)


					Paul
Hey uh, you really buying this guy? 

					Lou 
Wha-?

					Fred 
(Slams a gun on the table, imitating a teacher slamming a ruler on a table to get the class's attention.)
Paul! No talking during the presentation! Have you stopped at wishing to see a world full of Ubermensch? 

					Paul
Holy shit man! Where the hell did you get a fucking gun?!

					Fred
Found it. 
(beat, Fred throws the gun behind him) 
Thanks to Paul we seem to have gone off topic. I’m sorry Lou I hope this isn’t upsetting you!

					Lou
No worries Fred. I know that you have the biggest and brightest mind out of anyone here! I know you’ll be able to-

					Fred
				(under his breath, said quickly)
I love you 

					Lou
Excuse me?

					Fred
				         (Blushing)
I said I ADORE your comments of affirmation! Oh look! You’ve made me blush! 
			
					Paul
				(Imitading Fred)
Thanks to Fred we seem to have gone off topic! Blah blah blah commune time baby! 

		(Lou laughs at what Paul said and Nietzche begins to clench his fist. Fred takes a deep breath and does an obvious fake laugh with the rest of the two)

Fred
Oh Paul! You sure are-are something ha! Woowhee with all of this positive energy I’m feeling  like it's time to finally name our commune! I’ll gladly go first! (writes TCC on the white board) I think we should call it TCC! 				
					Paul
What does TCC stand for?

					Fred
The Concentration Commune! I chose this name to recognize our devoted followers being extremely concentrated and well minded while going down the path to become a true ubermensch! 

					Paul
Okay no I’m just going to stop you right there. 

					Fred
Why? Me and Lou both think it has a nice ring to it! 

					Paul 
Okay I don’t think she said that? And, this guy named Hitler like 40 years after you died set up these things called concentration camps all over Europe and they’re not exactly what you think. Hitler was also German so that probably wouldn’t help your case either. 

					Lou 
I would take Paul’s advice Fred, we don’t want to frighten people away, the world is different now! 

					Fred 
				(erases the white board furiously)
Okay Paul why don’t you come up with a name then? You’ll see that it’s not so easy to do-

					Paul 
Got it.

					Fred
What? That fast?

					Paul
Yeah
		
					Lou 
				    (romantically)
Impressive...

					Paul
I think we should call it TCC.

					Fred
Wow okay how original! 

					Lou
Quiet Fred! I want to see where Paul is going with this.

					Paul
Thank you Lou, what TCC stands for in my eyes is The Cool Commune. 

					Fred 
Seriously? 
					Lou
Oh Paul that’s a wonderful idea! It has such a nice ring to it..gosh I can see it now, headlines depicting the positive impact that we’ve created upon this world with our Cool Commune! The history books would be talking about it for centuries! You’ve struck gold Paul, and I couldn’t be more proud of you. (Jumping chair up & down as Lou is moving closer to Paul)

					Paul
Shit you really think? 
(beat)
Oh I mean, thank you Lou. 

					Fred
Let’s not get ahead of ourselves now! Hello remember I still exist haha! I kinda like you know, brought everyone here together and like without me your lives would be sort of uh….meaningless!
(Beat)
Now like the proper adults we are, let's take a vote. Should we name our commune MY ORIGINAL version of TCC (Only Fred raises his hand) or should we just do Pauls (Both Lou and Paul raise their hands) 
Paul put your hand down, you can’t vote for yourself!

					Paul
Woah, what! You just did! 

					Fred
Yeah well your stupid! 

					Lou
		     (has arms around Paul in a “protective” manor) 
Frederick! Don’t yell at the man that is going to rebuild our commune! We need to show him the utmost respect and care! I don’t want-WE don’t want to lose Paul. We love you Paul don’t listen to him when he gets like this.

					Paul 
	(gets up and walks towards the white board and grabs the marker out of Fred’s hand and writes The Cool Commune)
If you like your idea so much...why don’t ya marry it. 

					Fred
			(does a defeated sigh and hangs his head low)
I was going to wait till we got to Sweden to do this, but you leave me no other choice Paul 
				(Fred slowly begins to get on one knee)

					Paul
Woah dude I wasn’t serious 
	
					Fred
Lou Andreas-Salomé, I don’t know how you’ve fallen for this fool twice now, but I’m here to make sure it's different this time. (pulls out a ring) Lou, you and I know we’re meant to be! Things just didn’t go our ways in our past lives, now it's different so can you just give me an actual shot this time! I can’t stand to watch you two interact knowing I’m supposed to be your romantic interest! I’ve been sitting here and planning this whole commune just for you, that's how much I love you!

					Lou
Let me get this straight. The only reason you were forming the commune again was because you knew I wanted to revive our commune in our new lives and if you somehow actually got it up and running, you were expecting me to say yes when you asked me for my hand in marriage? 

					Fred
Yes and look, we finally got a name for the commune! So just slid the ring on yo-

					Lou
No Fred no! I knew this was going to happen again but I told myself ‘No Lou, Freds changed he’ll actually focus this time on the commune and NOT ASK FOR YOUR HAND IN MARRIAGE LIKE HE DID IN THE PAST’. This is your third time asking me to marry you Fred! I’m sick of it, why do you think I’m attracted to Paul...It’s because he’s actually focusing on the commune! I can’t stand to be here. I have to go, please Fred get over me and focus on the commune. 
			(Lou collects her belongings and leaves) 

                                  				    Fred
Well ha I-I guess it’s just you and me Paul! Who needs her, am I right?! Look at us, brothers once again, off to change the world! 

Paul 
Get out Fred

Fred 
Paul please, I have nowhere else to go, we need this commune!

Paul
Just get out Fred. This whole mission of yours has been about you while I’ve just been on the sidelines acting as your punching bag. Lou was right, I’ve actually been focusing on this commune more than you have, you’re just embarrassing man. Now go

Fred
(Clears throat in a defeated tone)
Mm yes I see, well I thank you for your hospitality Paul (goes in for a hug but Paul steps back) right sorry not the best time. Guten nacht my friend, I’ll send you a postcard from wherever I am. (Fred opens the door and leaves) 
(Paul looks at the door and goes over to the doorknob and holds it for a second, contemplating opening it. He then takes his hand off the knob, grabs the TV remote, turns on Jeopardy, and lays on the couch. Blackout)

Final scene 

(Lights shine on the inside of a log cabin as we see Fred working diligently at a desk. All over the cabin walls are classroom style motivational posters and a giant poster that says “Rules for the Cool Commune”. There’s a knock at Fred’s door) 

					Fred
(Jumps out of his seat with excitement as he rushes towards the door. Fred opens the door revealing Paul and Lou. Fred then says in his original voice)
No freaking way! You guys actually came! 
(Gives both of them a giant hug)
Well just don’t stand there! Come on in and make yourselves at home! 				(All find a comfortable place to sit. The group is silent for a bit before Fred asks with excitement.)
Sooooo what do you guys think of the commune??	

					Lou
It’s-it’s breathtaking Fred! It’s exactly what I envisioned our commune to look like in our past lives! 

					Paul
Yeah, it looks great man you really tied it all together. Also, good choice of location, I’m so glad you picked Sweden. 
(beat)
What happened to your voice by the way? 

					Fred
Oh right I forgot to mention in the postcard, like second week into the commune I somehow reverted back to my normal self. Surprise!! I’m no longer Frederick Nietzsche, now I'm Frederick Neatche! 

					Paul
So wait, you're still Nietzsche but without the accent? 

					Fred
No dude, my name is Frederick Neatche. Last name spelled N-e-a-t-c-h-e

				       Paul & Lou
Ohhhhhh

					Paul
Wait, how did you keep all your memories of us and what happened 3 years ago when you thought you were the other Nietzsche? Cause didn’t you forget everything that happened before you’re uh “Rebirth”? 

					Fred 
				(Shrugs his shoulders)


		(Both writers come out on stage again and shrug their shoulders)

					Writer 2
Look, we don't know what to tell you, we just want to get our show over with okay?

			    (Writer 1 and 2 leave stage right) 

					Lou
So you’re no longer my Nietzsche? You mean he’s like, gone forever?

					Fred
Apparently so. I’m sorry Lou, I kne- 

					Lou
Lets go!! Creepy Nietzsche is out of my life!! I honestly thought another proposal was going to happen when I got here haha! 

					Paul 
				(Throws a box with a ring in it out the window)
Huh yeah, that would’ve sucked if that happened again. I'm glad he’s out of our lives huh am I right.

Fred
 Me too Paul. I’m glad he’s out of my brain, but we should also be thanking creepy  Nietzsche because look what he did, he brought all of us back together! 

					Lou
Well actually, it was the postcard 

					Fred
I was still creepy  Nietzsche at that point while writing the postcard so actually, it was him
(beat)
Hey Paul, look at the name of the commune. 

					Paul
Ah sick you actually kept the name! 

					Fred
Of course I did, it's a genius name man! 
(beat) 
Now I have a very important question for you two. Do you guys want to join the Cool Commune?

<h2> Notes From Chapter 9 Of My Positive Psych Book</h2>
<p>
Chap 9 

A core assumption of positive psychology is that human beings have the potential to conduct themselves with extraordinary competence, compassion, and dignity
Many research areas of positive psychology have focused on how people are able to achieve these admirable behaviors despite the numerous temptations that entice them toward selfishness, indulgence, or greed
 Today, various researchers working from a positive psychology perspective have investigated topics such as how to nurture “your best self” (Sheldon & Lyubomirsky, 2006b) and how to foster your “true self”
All the perspectives discussed in this chapter are aligned with the eudaimonia perspective on well-being
g. You will recall that it focuses on personal growth, optimal self-development, and a search for meaning (Waterman, 2015).
Rather, in the eudaimonia perspective the primary goals in life involve a search for personal growth and meaning; happiness and positive emotion are regarded as by-products of that search
A more complete vision of well-being involves both eudaimonia and hedonia
Attempts to describe optimal psychological well-being date back to the earliest days of psychology. William James was strongly interested in mental health issues and especially in exceptional states of well-being
James (1902/1958) asserted that the psychologically healthy personality was “harmonious and well balanced.” He also asserted that fulfillment of one’s creative and aesthetic potentials was the hallmark of mental health

Wisdom: what did King Solomon Have? 
Wisdom has been one of the most frequent terms used to describe optimal maturity throughout Western history
The Bible tells us that King Solomon was wise, and the Greek philosophers speculated for centuries about wisdom and how it should be the ultimate goal of life
. In the Jewish tradition, wisdom is a venerated quality and associated with leading a righteous—that is, highly ethical—life. 
ancient Judaic text Pirkey Avoth (Ethics of the Fathers) taught that wisdom involves a life based on sacred study of the Bible and one that contributes to the well-being of others



Preliminary Wisdom About Wisdom 
In general, wisdom is a unique positive result of long developmental processes, not merely a storehouse of information or opinions. 
Wisdom implies knowledge that is social, interpersonal, and psychological, which may be difficult for the average person to attain
Kramer (2000) stated that wisdom is “exceptional breadth and depth of knowledge about the conditions of life and human affairs”
Labouvie-Vief (1990) proposed that wisdom involves the dialectical integration of two forms of knowledge: logos and mythos.
. Logos is knowledge gained through the use of analytical, propositional, and other formal structures of logic
Mythos is knowledge gained through speech, narrative, plot, or dialogue
It is knowledge embedded in the context of social relationships and experiences and includes intuition and openness to unconscious processes. 
Pascual-Leone (1990) sounded similar themes in his perspective on wisdom. He added a theoretical statement on what he calls the “ultraself” or “transcendent self” as a hallmark of wisdom
This ultraself operates as a higher, more encompassing center of information processing able to integrate cognitive and emotional processes, particularly love and care. 
Kramer (2000) referred to this ability as a form of self-transcendence that is a “detached, but encompassing, concern with life itself” (p. 86).
Kramer (2000) also reviewed much of the existing research on wisdom. In her view, the two major elements of wisdom are greater openness to experience and a “capacity to reflect on and grapple with difficult existential life issues”
 She noted that persons who are wise seem able to transform negative experiences into life-affirming experiences; through this process, they may even possess a sense of serenity that others lack
. Kramer also regarded individual wisdom as a potential resource for communities; that is, she urged communities to recognize that wise people do exist and they could be used more fully.
Jeffrey Webster (2003) measures wisdom with five components: 
openness to experience, emotional regulation, healthy coping with critical life experiences, reminiscence and reflectiveness, and a self-effacing sense of humor that recognizes life ironies
A study by Wink and Helson (1997) suggested two forms of wisdom
The first is practical wisdom, encompassing good interpersonal skills, clarity of thinking, greater tolerance, and generativity.
y. The second is transcendental wisdom, which deals with the limits of knowledge, the rich complexity of the human experience, and a sense of transcending the personal and individual aspects of human experience.
m, Kunzmann and Strange (2007) concluded three basic ways wisdom has been defined: 
as mature personality development,
 postformal reasoning,
as an expanded form of pragmatic or practical intelligence
Another review of the literature by Bangen, Meeks, and Jeste (2013) focused on the elements or traits usually associated with wisdom: 
knowledge of life, prosocial values, self-understanding, emotional homeostasis, tolerance, openness, selfunderstanding, and a sense of humor
Although many ways exist for defining and measuring wisdom, nearly all researchers agree that it is not simply the presence of certain traits or variables or elements; rather, it is the way in which these elements interact that is unique
The result of that interaction is a holistic and integrative way of approaching life’s challenges, a way that considers contextual variations, values, and tolerance and recognizes that life is full of necessary uncertainties
Bassett’s (2011) theory of emergent wisdom makes much the same point, that wisdom emerges out of a complex series of interactions among various wisdom-related capacities and abilities.
n, psychologists are fairly sure about what wisdom is not
 The first point made by most researchers is that wisdom is not the inevitable outcome of advanced age
it is also true that profound wisdom is 430 seen more often—though not exclusively—in persons who are at least middle aged
Earlier research by Baltes and Staudinger (2000) suggested that the optimal age to attain wisdom was about 60 years old
Later studies put the age range at closer to midlife (
For instance, there is a stronger relationship between age and wisdom in the United States than in Japan
The second point on which most psychologists agree is that wisdom is not merely intelligence as measured by IQ tests.

Wisdom and Well-Being 
Studies by Ardelt (1997, 2016) revealed that wisdom was significantly correlated with life satisfaction, sense of mastery, purpose in life, and greater physical well-being for both men and women. 
Studies by Ardelt (1997, 2016) revealed that wisdom was significantly correlated with life satisfaction, sense of mastery, purpose in life, and greater physical well-being for both men and women. 
Wisdom also seems related to well-being through association with increased striving for the good life and greater preferences for personal growth and self-actualization as well as associations with autonomy, psychological mindedness, purpose in life, and basic personality traits such as openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness
Studies have also found that wise people show emotional and motivational preferences that enhance well-being. They report fewer self-centered pleasant feelings but more process-oriented and environment-centered emotions, such as interest or inspiratio
). Wise people also prefer values focused on personal growth, insight, social engagement, or the well-being of friends, as opposed to values focused mainly on pleasure and a comfortable life
. Finally, wise persons prefer cooperative management styles that reflect a joint concern for both their own and the other person’s interest. That is, they reject approaches to conflict management in which one person wins at the other’s expense

Wisdom as a Stage of Life 

The most familiar perspective on wisdom in general psychology was advanced by Erikson (1950). He regarded wisdom as the virtue that results from a successful resolution of the last psychosocial stage of development:
integrity versus despair
This last life stage challenge involves a need to review one’s life and see what one has accomplished
For Erikson, wisdom involves both an acceptance of life as it has been lived and the reality of approaching death. He also viewed wisdom as “involved disinvolvement,” or a commitment to the process of life with a calm detachment from insisting that life turn out a specific way. 

Wisdom as Postformal Cognitive Development 
A second perspective describes wisdom in terms of postformal cognitive thought and dialectical modes of thinking. The last stage in Piaget’s theory of cognitive development is formal-operational thinking.
This stage involves being able to use abstract concepts in solving problems, and most people begin using it during adolescence.
m Solansky (2013), who postulated that the search for wisdom is partially driven by a fear of appearing foolish. This is especially important in light of research showing that people who perceive themselves as experts can reach nonsensical conclusions
The theory of emergent wisdom proposes that wisdom involves a unique kind of thinking that moves from simple to complex, from independence and individualism to interdependence and from self-focus to a concern for the common good
In this theory, wisdom involves four major components:
 discerning, or a deep understanding of fundamental patterns and relationships; 
respecting, or considerate and thoughtful dealing with others; 
engaging, or acting in ethical ways for the common good; and 
transforming, or looking inward and tolerating paradox, ambiguity, and uncertainty
y. One fascinating element of the wisdom literature involves what has been called “Solomon’s paradox.” This clever title refers to the fact that many people are able to use wise reasoning styles when solving other people’s conflicts, but they fail to use wise strategies when attempting to solve their own conflicts

Wisdom as a Form of Excellence 

A third psychological approach regards wisdom as a specific type of excellence
Baltes and Staudinger (2000) found it useful to conceptualize wisdom as a multifaceted phenomenon that can be understood only by examining many different predictors
This orientation seems similar to the confluence approach used in the study of creativity
. In another interesting parallel with a leading conceptualization of creativity, Baltes and Staudinger (2000) argued that wisdom is a joint product between the individual and his or her environment.
Baltes and Staudinger (2000) took their understanding of wisdom even further and implied a relationship with ethics, stating that wisdom is “knowledge with extraordinary scope, depth, measure, and balance … a synergy of mind and character; that is an orchestration of knowledge and virtue”
Kunzmann (2004) added that wisdom is an integration of knowledge and particular emotional experiences, such as a greater ability to regulate one’s emotions and higher capacity for othercentered emotion
These researchers also regard the concept of wisdom as complex, highly differentiated, and associated with diverse cultural meanings

Predictors of Wisdom 
The research studies of Baltes and Staudinger (2000) found that wisdom can be predicted by examining four factors:
 1) intelligence, 
2) personality dispositions, 
3) cognitive styles, and 
4) life experiences.
In terms of intelligence, they found that high scores on measures of fluid and crystallized intelligence were significant predictors of wisdom
However, these factors accounted for only about 2% of the variation in wisdom scores
Similarly, personality dispositions such as openness to experience and psychological mindedness were significant predictors but accounted for an equally small percentage
—the assumption being that those who deal with life’s difficulties, complexities, and meanings in the course of psychotherapy may learn something about wisdom along the way
Cognitive styles also accounted for about 15% of wisdom. Among the better predictors were creativity and thinking styles termed judicial and progressive,
which describe the ability to evaluate and compare issues, as well as tolerate ambiguity.
 all this evidence implied that wisdom is “meta-heuristic,” that is, a highly organized strategy of searching relevant information from multiple sources and integrating it into solutions that optimize knowledge and virtue.
Later studies investigated two types of wisdom: personal and general
Mickler & Staudinger (2008) defined personal wisdom with five criteria including two “basic criteria,”
” 1) rich self-knowledge and 2) heuristics of personal growth/self-regulation, and 
three “meta-criteria”: 3) interrelating the self, 4) self-relativism, and 5) tolerance of ambiguity
They found that age was a more important predictor in the development of personal wisdom than of general wisdom. Specifically, they found no age differences in wisdom when examining the two basic criteria, but older adults scored lower than middle-aged adults on all of the meta-criteria
His balance theory of wisdom begins with the concept of tacit knowledge or knowledge embedded in individual experience and acquired through personal experiences, insight, or absorption in activities.
Sternberg (1998) defined wisdom as the application of tacit knowledge and personal values “toward the goal of achieving a common good”
 For Aristotle, wisdom was the “master” virtue that allowed a person to discern which virtues were most important and how the various virtues should be balanced in life. The appropriate development of strengths in one’s virtues allowed for the cultivation of practical wisdom
Such wisdom allows a person to navigate inevitable conflicts and translate character strengths and virtues into concrete action in real-life situations.
Fowers (2005) posited five character types, each defined by how well the virtues are acknowledged and balanced
The most mature character type is the virtuous. The virtuous character type is “able to act consistently in a way that is fitting, given the circumstances. Virtuous character is guided by a clear vision of what is good and admirable, and the individual acts consistently and gladly in the service of those goods”


In summary, wise people tend to pursue the “good life” by eudaimonic strategies that seek meaning and purpose in life as a primary goal and positive emotionality as a secondary goal

<h2>Screen Directions For A Film I Did Called Campus Dash</h2>
<p>
Revised Storyboard:
Shot 1
Character 3 sits at library table and finishes project, calls other characters
Medium shot, character 3 centered

Shot 2
Characters 1 and 2 answer the call at the same time on either side of the screen from different locations.
Shot 2A
Character 1 is taking a nap on the stairs and awoken by character 3’s call. They answer, have an “oh crap” reaction, and quickly scuttle off
Shot 2B
Character 2 is sitting outside and playing on their phone. They answer, also have an oh crap reaction, and hurry away. 

Shot 3
Character 1 sees their friend on their bike and in desperation, runs over to hijack the bike.
Character 1 runs into the frame creating an over the shoulder shot with the bike on the other side of the frame. Character 1 points at their friend mounting the bike and charges. Friend waves to them as they charge to convey friendship.
Wide shot of the bike rack behind Woodard Hall.

Shot 4
Character 1 uses violence to hijack bike (pull off, punch, shove, dealer's choice). 
Several ideas for this shot:
From the perspective of character 1: hold camera with steady hand in front of face, could be good for a fake punch 
From perspective of friend: follow the motion of friend receiving punch or shove with camera. End with the camera lower to the ground like friend got knocked on their ass.
We could do a shot/reverse/shot of the friend smiling and waving at first, then cut to character 1 winding up their attack, then cut to the friend realizing they’re about to get attacked by slowly putting their hand down and mouth oh fu- with the attack slowly peering into frame. It then would do match cut with a semi wide shot of the attack connecting, and the friend falling 

Shot 5
Friend is seen sitting on the ground where they would have landed. Character 1’s hand reaches into frame and pulls sunglasses off friend’s face. 
Medium shot with friend and hand on either side of frame (rule of thirds style). 

Shot 6
Character 1 puts on sunglasses and rides out of frame.
Medium shot zooming into a close shot when he puts on the sunglasses. Camera positioned lower to the side of the front wheel looking up. 
If the sunglasses we use have dark lenses, we could do a zoom into one of the lenses and have it transition to a close up of character two’s phone being off, but then quickly turning it on to look at what time it is.
*Shots 4-6 meant to be quick and very tightly cut together*


Shot 7
Character 2 runs onto the path and past the camera.
Wide shot of character 2 continuing motion from previous shot on one side of the frame and running past camera on other side of frame. 

Shot 8
Character 2 runs into over the shoulder shot with character 1 seen past shoulder. 
 Instead of an over the shoulder shot, we could have a side medium shot of character 2 running, and then character 1 slowly peers into frame. This then does a wide shot facing both characters next to each other. 
Cuts to a medium of them not notching each other at first, then quickly do and cuts to wide/match cut of them scattering (character 1 going left, character 2 going right)

Shot 9
Character 2 stays still and concentrates for teleportation match cut
Medium shot zooming to close shot

Shot 10
Character 2 teleports into car, shows happiness thinking they have the upper hand
Cut matches the previous close shot with character 2 center

Shot 11
Character 1 reacts to teleport and quickly rides around the curve to start going down the hill towards the tunnel.
Diagonal wide shot?



Shot 12
Medium shot from passenger seat pointed up
Character 2 takes out keys from pocket and starts the car

Shot 13
Character 1 zooms through the tunnel entrance, down the tunnel, and past the camera
Wide shot
Shot 14
Character 2 calmly makes a turn, giving old lady driver vibes
Either medium/ close shot from just past the wheel, or close shot pointed directly up with camera sitting in lap
Shot 15
Character 1 glides down the tunnel and accidentally rides past the library, realizes they rode past and abruptly stops
Continuing shot 13 but now riding away from the camera
Shot 16
Character 1 quickly turns their head around giving a look of determined desperation
Close up of character 1’s head from behind, they turn to look at the camera, quick zoom
Shot 17
Character 2 parks, gets out of car and runs out of frame towards the path in front of the hcc
Wide shot in front of parking spot

Shot 18
Character 1 rides back and hops off bike on the left side of the library entrance
Wide shot with character 1 riding towards the camera, following rule of thirds might be cool

Shot 19
Character 2 runs down the hill, down the steps in front of the hcc, and curbs in the direction of the library
Wide shot with character 2 from in front of the hcc, pan a little towards the tunnel when they run past
Shot 20
Characters 1 and 2 reach the door at the same time and barge in, we already filmed this bit. 

Good news is the revised edit only has 2 scenes with the two characters on screen together, other shots can be filmed individually if we don’t get to them today.

<h2>Batman's Day Off - From Funky Stories</h2>
<p>

Batman's Day off
	It’s 8:30 in the morning, the sun is out without a cloud in the sky. You’re currently reading in your den, your hand holding the daily newspaper while having a freshly brewed cup of coffee to go with it. You take a sip of your coffee, knowing damn well you deserve it because of how fantastic this morning is. So far, you woke up at 5 am to do your early morning workouts. After that you then proceeded to wash your car, clean your tools, and organize some files, all of this being done by 8:15am which is your earliest. While you're thinking about this morning, your butler, Alfred Pennyworth, enters the den with your breakfast on a silver platter. 

That's right, you are Bruce Wayne sitting in your den in Wayne Manor, located in Gotham City. You’re a Billionaire playboy philanthropist by day but by night, you’re the world's greatest detective and caped crusader, Batman.

As Alfred places your food down the table near you, he overlooks your shoulder, noticing the headline on the paper. “Day 1 of Zero Crime in Gotham?” Alfred looking at you in a puzzled manner asks, “Do you think this could be real, sir?” You sit there for a moment, thinking about how this could finally be your day off as Batman. You look at Alfred, confidently saying “It’s 8:47 and the Batphone hasn’t rung 5 times already like it usually has, I think this might be our day off.” Alfred, a bit hesitant of the idea of Batman having a ‘day off’ then asks you, “Well if that be the case, what are you going to do today?” 

You respond to Alfred with a hmm, placing your hand on your chin in a thinking pose. 

Go Gambling(A1) - You’re the richest man in Gotham, what's stopping you? 

Test Gadgets)B2)- You have a million of high tech gadgets right at your finger tips, lets see what they can really do. 

Ask Alfred if he wants to go shopping(A3)- You guys haven’t done that in a while, Gotham mall just got renevented. Also, you and Alfred deserve a break

Go to Arkham Asylum to see if everything is really all right(D1) - You notice the worry on Alfred’s face, maybe he’s right and something is up


Arrive at Gotham Casino (A1)
	
	You speed down the vast streets of Gotham heading towards the exquisite Gotham Casino. As you make your way closer to the casino, you suddenly realize you’re missing something very important. You forgot to bring some money to gamble with. You do a quick face plant, pull over, and start pressing a couple buttons on the batcomputer you have in your car that directs you to your bank account. You dispense some cash for yourself through the mini ATM you have in your car. As you pocket your money, you turn off your hazards, merge back on the street, and continue racing down the Gotham streets.

	
     As you arrive at the casino, you begin to feel nervous about throwing your money away at a casino. What would your parents Thomas and Martha Wayne think of you? You look at the doors of the brightly lit casino, then back at the dark and empty road as you contemplate what to do.

Do you?
Enter in Gotham Casino(A2)- Tonight might be your night, who knows you could end up with a huge profit in return

Drive alone with your thoughts(B1)- Your nervousness kills your mood to gamble, you want to be alone with your thoughts 

Vroom Vroom 
B1
	As you speed down the quiet, dimly lit Gotham streets, you let out a long exhale. you’ve never had this much time alone to yourself and thoughts. Sure, sitting on tap gargoyles all night is relaxing, but sirens and screams get in the way. While you’re deep in your thoughts, you become aware of how quiet it is. To help make it less awkward, you open Spotify to see if you can find the right playlist to put on to fit the mood. You find your playlist, hit shuffle, and let the music take control 

	As you’re driving and jamming to your tunes, your low fuel light comes on. You pull over to the nearest gas station, place the pump in the batmobile, and go to the convenient store for a quick bathroom break. You walk out of the store, looking out in the night sky and see not the bat signal, but instead the newly renovated and grandiose Gotham Mall. The sight of it captures your attention 

	Do you? 
	Go to the Gotham Mall- It’s newly renovated with a lot of shops, you can call Alfred asking if he wants to go as he's been talking about how he has been meaning to go. (C1)

	Keep Driving- You’re not materialistic, you’re batman. You don’t need shiny things to keep you happy, just need your thoughts. (B2)

	Holy Strip Mall Batman!(C1)
	
	Alfred agrees to go to Gotham Mall with you, and you two take off in the batmobile. As your driving to the mall, you and Alfred chat about the day while bumping to music. While the chat between you and Alfred is nice, it begins to slow down. Eventually there’s a moment of silence during the conversation as Alfred looks out the window with a worried expression. 

            “What’s wrong Alfred?” You ask, turning down the music. Alfred responds by saying how he still feels nervous about today. You respond saying that it’s okay and that the mall will be safe, but Alfred brings up how they could have an attack planned at the mall. your doubts about today and the mall begin to grow. 
	
What do you do?
Go to Arkham Asylum- Drop Alfred back off at Wayne Manor. your rogues gallery may be plotting against you, make sure that doesn’t happen.D1

Still go to the Mall- you feel confident about today and you have your bat credit card, what could go wrong?C2

Arkham Asylum 

	As you’re driving down the night streets of Gotham towards Arkham Asylum, a heavy downpour emerges. Sounds of Thunder accompanied by  sparks of Lightning burst and cover the sky. You start to slow down a bit due to the weather, but the thought of your villains plotting against you and Gotham has you pushing harder on the pedal. You take a sharp turn to left and enter through the gates of Arkham Asylum 
	You jump out of the Batmobile, running towards the large entrance oak doors of Arkham Asylum. You put your hand up the door handle ready to enter, but you stop for a moment and think. ‘What if Alfred is wrong? What if today is really my day off and Gotham is really safe for once’. You stand there, contemplating if you should enter into the Asylum which could have you possibly save the city or if you should leave, possibly putting you in the city in danger. 

	What do you do?
	Enter into Arkham - Gotham needs you, you can’t let Gotham, Alfred, or anyone down. You must put a stop to whatever is going on. (D2)

	Go to the Casino - You think everything will be fine and that you're overthinking it way too much. Take your mind off of it by gambling (A1)

	A2 In the Casino 

	As you enter into Gotham Casino, all heads immediately turn to you with all of the attendees gasping and awing at your presence. As you’re walking through the casino the guest clear a path for you as you approach a roulette table. You bet on your lucky spot on the table, which is a red 36. The dealer then spins the roulette table with the ball dropping quickly on the table after their spin. You hold your breath with your eyes intensely following the movement of the ball, eventually landing on your lucky spot. Relieved, you exhale and pick up your winnings. 

	Your next stop are the slot machines, where you find yourself winning jackpot after jackpot. As you're collecting your coins with a multitude of metal buckets, you look over and spot a poker table. You go over to the table, sit yourself down, and begin to play. You begin to develop a winning streak at the poker table as every round you’ve won, until someone challenges you by going all in. Shifting your cards through your hands, you decide what to do. 
What do you do? 

	

	

	Do you?
	Go all in- Your luck is tremendous tonight go for it, plus you don’t want this guy taking out your hot streak A3

	Fold and go back to driving- Humble yourself, while your Batman on the outside, your Bruce Wayne underneath, be smart with your money. B2

	Drag Race 

	As you continue speeding down the ambient streets of Gotham, you begin to get a bit tired behind the wheel, as you're starting to swerve to the side of the road. You try slapping yourself awake, but that doesn't work as you can feel your eyelids starting to get heavy. You turn up your music to the max to see if that’ll work, but that only gives you a headache. Alfred then calls you  

	As you pop a quick u-turn in the batmobile, you begin to race home as you can feel yourself get more tired. As you’re getting close to Wayne Manor, you call Alfred through the batmobile to tell him to get ready to go to Gotham Mall. As you hang up the call and stop at a red light, a gang of hooligans in a modified sedan come up next to you, revving their engine. This gives you a boost of adrenaline as you rev your engine back at them, yours sound louding and impending. You’re both revving your engines at each other waiting for the red light to change green. 

	What do you do?

	Drag Race- show these fools how fast the batmobile can really go 

	Don’t drag race- Alfred is waiting for you at the mall, you wouldn’t want to leave him alone, would you? 

	C2 At the mall 

	You and Alfred explore the mall with no signs of impending doom lurking afoot. While in the mall, you both gaze at how luxurious and colorful the mall is with all of its different shops. You and Alfred traverse through the mall, hitting every shop that you can. As you make your final purchases, you make your way to the food court located in the front of the mall.

	You and Alfred find a place to eat and a table to sit at. While you two are eating, Alfred says how it’s been a surprisingly pleasant day at the mall, he thanks you for today. As you agree and accept his thanks, you then get an unexpected and unknown phone call. You answer the phone, hearing a voice you don’t recognize informing you that someone has taken over Arkham Asylum. Ending the call, you inform Alfred of the news. As the fun spirit washes away from him, he asks concerningly “What are you going to do?”. 
Do you?
Go to Arkham Asylum- Someone has taken over Arkham Asylum, that’s not good. You need to get over there now, plus Alfred wants to stay at the mall. 

Continue shopping- it could’ve been a prank call, you’re famous people look up your number all the time. Commissioner Gordon can handle it anyway.

D2 
	As you enter the monstrous  Asylum, it's completely dark with the only sounds being the patter of rain on the roof. An intense clap of thunder bellows as a bolt of lighting illuminates the sky, with the inside of the asylum being lit for a few moments. From what you can see, the guards are nowhere to be found and the Asylum is in ruins. 

	You call out to ask who’s there with the response you get being an evil laugh from an unknown source. As you scream out for the person behind the laugh to show themselves, another flash of lighting illuminates the asylum, revealing one of your lower threat villains, Calendar Man. Calendar Man begins to walk over to you, reciting his evil monologue about how he’s the smartest villain since through his calendars, he knew today was your day off. While Calander Man is giving his monologue, your mind begins to go elsewhere as your daydream about how you should’ve gone to the casino because you could’ve won a fortune. Calendar Man is one of your least threatening villains, you’re sure everything will be fine if you take him down tomorrow, right? 

What do you do?

Take down Calendar Man- You’re Batman, even if it is a low threat villain, you always have to get the job done and protect Gotham 

Leave Arkham and go to the casino - C’mon it’s calendar Man, no one is scared of him. You could win big tonight and capture him in the morning tomorrow 

Bike 

It’s a beautiful Saturday morning in the city of Fredericksburg, Virginia. As you arise from your slumber, you hear birds singing a beautiful tune instead of your crummy alarm clock. As you hop out of bed and get ready for the day, a thought pops into your head….I should go biking today! Instead of putting on your regular clothes, you go to the back of your closet to put on your special biking clothes. You step outside, walking confidently towards your nice, shiny and modified red bike. 

You take off going down the street to do the usual path you follow, ready for another adventure on your bike. As you’re in downtown Fredericksburg, a car unexpectedly backs out on the street, disrupting your ride. You lose control of your bike as you swerve off the street into an alleyway. You collect yourself in the alleyway and as you begin to get ready to get back on the route, you see that four pathways are facing you. The first pathway leads to a city, second to a forest, third to a bike trail, and fourth to something that looks otherworldly. You look back and see that there is no more Fredericksburg, Virginia. Your only way out is through one of these pathways 

Which pathway do you choose?
Pathway one- This city could be a different part of Fredericksburg you’re not familiar with. Plus you could get help there 

Pathway two- There could be some campers or hikers that could help or tell you where you are in the forest. Who knows maybe you’ll get cell service while you’re there 

Pathway Three- What an innocent looking bike trail! What could go wrong? 

Pathway Four- Could that object be aliens? Maybe they could be friendly aliens and fly you back home in an UFO

CityA1
You enter a city, feeling like you’ve definitely seen this part of Fredericksburg before. The buildings and street names all look the same, but something in the air feels off. You begin to grow hope on getting back on your bike path as you see a sign that reads, Downtown Fredericksburg Next Left. Your confidence is quickly killed, however as you turn a corner and instead of a pleasant downtown area, you see a swarm of crashed and abandoned cars. As you're about to traverse through the wreckage, you spot the light of a  radio tower towards your left in the distance. The radio tower however, seems to be located deep in a forest.

What do you do?

Traverse through the wreckage- This looks like Fredericksburg, maybe downtown is closed because of the wreckage

Go towards the radio tower- You could easily radio for help and find out where you are from there, and the forest doesn’t look that bad 

B1
Forest 

As you enter the forest, all is quiet. You begin biking down deeper and deeper into the forest, time seems to be speeding up as the sky becomes darker by the second. You stop biking as it’s now pitch black with only the moon light illuminating the forest. As your stopped, you reach into a drawstring bag you brought and fetch a helmet flashlight. As you attach the light on, you hear a snap of a tree branch in front of you. 

You turn your light on, hands shaking as you hesitantly click the button, seeing a tall humanoid creature staring down at you. You quickly hop on your bike pushing the pedals to metal down the forest. As you are speeding down the forest with that thing following you close behind, you spot a pitch black tunnel that looks like it would be too small for the creature to fit through.. 





What do you do?

Enter tunnel- you could escape the humanoid creature by going into the 
tunnel, surely nothing dangerous will be in there

Keep biking down forest- That cave doesn’t look too safe, you’ll find another place to escape to you just have to keep pedaling 

C1 
You are goin down a simple bike path. You pull over, take some photos of trees, flowers, bugs, and other things you find interesting while on the path. There is really nothing to complain about here, until you get up to the troll guarding the rest of the trail. The troll has a wooden club pointed right at you and asks what your favorite color is. If youThe only condition is that if you get it wrong, they’ll have to club so hard that you go through space and time 

Purple 

Yellow

D1
You go down a path towards the otherworldly object, seeing it start to grow larger as you get closer to it. You stop for a minute to get a better view of it, but as you’re stopped you keep moving towards it. You realize what you’re looking at is an interdimensional portal. You spot a wrecked and abandoned city you could escape towards as you're trying to outrun the portal. The only option left is to use the dangerous modified 6th gear that has a skull and crossbones on it

What do you do?

Go 6th Gear- You’ll get to press a cool button. Plus you could catch your breath for a minute at the city 

Go through portal- Maybe the portal wont be so bad, maybe it’ll teleport you somewhere cool

A2
You pass through the wreckage in the city safely, getting a minute to finally breath and gather your thoughts. You open your phone to see if you can call for help. While you’re searching for help on your phone, you hear an army of people walking straight towards you. As you look up from your phone, you see a hoard of zombies coming straight towards you. 
What do you do?

Stay and fight- Your bike is your weapon, plus it’s modified

Escape- there’s a tunnel just to the right of you that could travel safely through the city but underground. 

B2 
Tunnel 

You make it safely out of the tunnel with no scrapes or bruises. As you make it out the tunnel you find what looks to be your house in perfect condition, no hoards of zombies around it. Excited, you race up to the door on your bike, but as you’re about to enter you stop and think for a moment, what if this isn’t real? I mean, you’ve had a pretty crazy day. What if this is another trick or illusion?

Trust House- it's yours house there could be nothing bad there, you need to take nap after today 

Don’t trust house- continue towards a sign leading towards a bike trail 

C2- 
As you continue to go down the bike trail you spot a UFO coming at you in the distance. Frightened by the speed its coming at you at, you take off, breaking off the path of the bike trail. The UFO gains on however and has you cornered. As you think you’re about to get zapped by a laser, an alien approaches you, asking if you’d like a lift home. As you’re about to answer a portal opens up with another alien popping out saying not to trust that alien and to trust him as he can bring you home. 

Who do you go with?
The UFO alien- it would be cool to ride in a ufo, and you would be the first biker in space 

Portal alien- A portal would also be cool to go through, you could be the first biker to go through a portal

D2
As you travel through the long and windy space portal, you find yourself face to face with the council of aliens. They say that you biking today caused a time loop due to a large shift in the space time continuum. They say you can go home now and survive, but everything else around you will cease to exist. Or you can go back to the city and retrace your steps to break the time loop and fix the space time continuum.

Which one do you take?

Teleporter 1- Go home 

Teleporter 2 Fix Everything 


<h2>A Research Study I Did In Which I Looked To Examine The Link Between Misinformed Memory Recall And Eyewitness Trials </h2>

<p>
B. Description of Research
Rationtional for goals of the research Provide a brief literature review that identifies key research in this area and what the research project seeks to examine, how the project contributes to a broader understanding of the topic indeftief, and whether or how the project will benefit society
In this study, I plan to examine how misinformation can disrupt an individual's memory when serving on the witness stand, leading them to form false memories about the event. To be investigating how this can affect them on a witness trial. There have been a significant amount of empirical studies investigating how when presented with misinformation, one can form false memories about the information over a certain period of time.
Zhu et al. (2011) conducted a longitudinal study focusing on how exposure to brief misinformation, could possibly lead to false memories developing in a year and half span within the individual. In their study, Zhu et al. (2011) presented participants with a recognition questionnaire, however in the follow up study, the presentation of the photos would be manipulated as some wouldn’t be shown to the participants. They instead had to recall the missing image. Researchers found there was a significant effect in their result about misinformation and creation of false memories. In their first study, 61% recalled true memories of the event while 31% recalled false memories, however over a one and a half year span, there was an increase in false memory recall as it went up by 39% with true memory recall decreasing at 45%. There also have been studies that investigated how when on a witness stand, misinformation can lead to false memories which affect the trial. Cullen et al. (2021), conducted two experiments focusing on manipulating the presentation of a crime reenactment video. This was in order to see how often participants would recall misinformation presented in the video over true information. What Cullen at al. (2021) found in both experiments was that when participants were presented with information about the crime, most of the participants were more likely to accept the misinformation that they were given rather than questioning it. Smith et al. (2017) also found evidence showing that misinformation can affect memory recall in individuals who are bilingual and are presented with misinformation from a different cultural and lingual background.
The significance of these findings is that they show evidence for a possible effect between purposefully misinformation and memory recall, while also showing how the effects of false memory recall can be amplified during an eyewitness trial. We can see this as there was a noticeable shift between false memory recall scores before and after the week break, as the score from the first test was 31% but after their week break, their scores went up to 39%. We also see evidence for their being a link between culture and language being a factor for misinformed memory recall. The relevance of these findings to my study is that I would like to combine all of these factors together to see which one will have the largest effect on individuals from individualistic or collectivistic cultures. 
As previously mentioned, the information on the cultural differences when presented with misinformation during an eyewitness trial is heavily scarce. Given the literature we currently have so far about how cultures are affected by misinformation, I would like to investigate the effect purposeful misinformation has on individualistic and collectivistic cultures and which will be affected most with memory recollection on the eyewitness stand. In this study, I plan on measuring the responses given when presented with misinformation and the cultural differences of their interpretations and responses. To do this, I will perform a longitudinal within-group study. I will recruit groups of participants from different gender and cultural backgrounds to watch a crime video where it would be detailed out in their cultural language. After viewing the video, the participants will answer a recognition test asking about the event. After a week break, the same group of participants would come back to review the video, still detailed in their cultural language, but certain now with key information turning into misinformation. Participants will either get the choice to review their answers about the video or they can trust their memory, leaving their answers as is. I predict that there will be a significant effect to show the cultural differences in interpreting misinformation on the witness stand. I also predict that there will be some signs of cultural similarities when  interpreting misinformation on the witness stand too. The importance of this question is that it would contribute to the scare literature that's about culture and misinformation on the witness stand, while also shedding light on important cultural differences when interpreting misinformation that we may tend to overlook during intense moments.
2. Method of Data collection and identification of procedures and interventions	 Describe exactly what participants will do in the study, from the moment they begin participation to the end. Describe and attach all data collection instruments, including research questions asked for participants. Indicate any voice, video, digital, or image recordings will be used and include requisite consent forms.                           	 
Design:
My design will consist of a 2 (culture) x 2 (memory) x 2 (Stimulus type) x 2 (instructions) mixed design. Culture will operate between two independent levels, the two levels [HS1] of culture are individualistic versus collectivistic and will be independent groups [HS2] For my presentation of culturally specific eyewitness [HS3] question information, it will also revolve around two independent levels. These two levels are truthful information versus purposeful misinformation a[HS4] bout the event. The stimulus type which is the crime video that the participants will view is a within group as all participants in the study will be viewing the vide[HS5] o and then retold the story by the judge. With this, each of the participants will engage in the same steps in this study all the way until [HS6] the end, making the instructions another [HS7] within group. Our independent variable in this study are the questions and presentation of misinformation that we’ll be showing participants as they’ll be manipulated by us, while the dependent variable is the recall ability rate with affect of purposeful misinformation.
Procedure:
Arrival 
In order to collect my data for my research, I will be in a psychology lab with two large rooms that are designed to look exactly like a courtroom. One of these rooms will house individuality cultures while the other collectivist. There will be a mock judge, audience, security, and other courtroom individuals to help make the participants feel more immersed in the experience as we’d want authentic answers. During the pre-misinformation stage we plan to collect our data on a Saturday at 11am till 2pm since most people have off on the weekends and hopefully many won’t have any morning plans. It’s also been shown that Cognitive functioning works the best at around 11-12pm (Evans et al., 2017).
When the participants arrive, they’ll be greeted and led to a private room where they’ll engage in answering 5 questionnaires before they perform in the actual study. When they enter the room, they’ll sit in the chair that is next to table with 3 sheets of paper on it. These sheets of paper consist of two questionnaires and a consent form. The participants will engage in the consent sheet (Appendix A). If the participant doesn’t feel comfortable doing the study anymore they can ask to leave the room and we will direct them out. After participants finish this sheet, they can just set it to side of the table they’re working on as they’ll next complete the Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire (MMQ) (Troyer & Rich, 2018) (Appendix B). The materials used in this will just be sheets of paper with the questions on it and pencil. The reason the participants will engage in the MMQ is so we test to see where the recall ability and rate is prior to testing. When the participants finish working on the multifactorial memory questionnaire they will engage next in the culture orientation scale (Appendix C) (Triandis, & Gelfland, 1998). After completing this and placing all papers to the side of the table, the participants can leave the room and wait in the hallway to indicate that they’re finished.
While participants are waiting, we’ll quickly have our statistical assistant tally up their scores while not showing them to us in order to determine where they land on the individualistic and collectivistic culture spectrum. When the results for that are finally finished, we’ll begin placing participants into their respective courtrooms. When participants enter into the courtroom, they’ll be directed to sit in the eyewitness seats. When participants reach their seats, one of the courtroom helpers will roll out a TV that will display a reenactment of a crime video (Appendix D). After viewing the video, each of the participants will be handed a sheet of paper that holds 5 questions that focuses on culturally specific questions about the vide[HS16] o (appendix E) that each of the participants will answer as this is our dependent variable. The questions will focus on the central (Ex. What color was the man shirt?) and background elements (Ex. What time of day was it?) in the video. For individualistic groups, there will be a heavier focus on central items while for collectivist there will be a heavier focus on background item questions. This split is due to how those in individualistic cultures have tend to have their attention on more central details (color of man shirt or hair) while those in collectivist cultures like to look at more bigger picture items (time of day or weather at the time) (Jiao & Zhao,. 2023). When the participants are handed the sheet, the judge will read over the questions aloud. When participants are finished they will be directed out of the courtroom. 
There will be a week-long break so the information in the participants' heads can settle. When the participants return after the break, they will be directed into their culturally specific same room with the same judge they had as before. The judge will greet them and will give a quick reminder to both culture groups about the video they witnessed last week. During this reminder however, the judge will alter the video story with small amounts of misinformation (Appendix F) when retelling the story to certain randomized culture groups. After being informed and reminded about the video, the participants will be handed their question sheet again but this time, the judge will say that the participants have the ability to change their answers if they feel like they answered wrong previously. The participants will be given 15 minutes to think about their responses and make changes if needed. After these 15 minutes, the participants will be directed to exit the courtroom.
Debriefing:
After our study, we will inform participants of the study they were just a part of and its purpose. We’ll also mention that if they don’t want us to use their data, they can email us to have it removed. We’ll tell participants that if they’re interested in the results of study overall, they can expect to see them on our website or can contact us for a hardcopy since it’ll be open access. After that, we’ll send our participants on their way home.
 
Measures and Materials:
Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire: Appendix B
The MMQ (Troyer & Rich, 2018) is a 3-level questionnaire that focuses on an individual’s memory satisfaction, strategy, and ability. Within each of these 3 levels, each level has a series of 18-20 questions that participants must answer regarding those 3 levels. The satisfaction level, consisting of 18 questions focusing on overall satisfaction of their memory while also asking about concerns. Participants can score between 0-72 in this level.  In the strategy level, it consists of 19 questions asking about how practical they are in daily decision making. Participants can score between 0-76 this level. The ability level consists of 20 common memory mistakes that participants are asked if they do, they can score between 0-80. This questionnaire has proper validity because it was operated and validated as a proper measurement in a previous study (Fiorella et al., 2021). We are using the test pre and post eyewitness study to test our participants memory recall ability and rate.
Culture Orientation Scale: Appendix C
The Culture Orientation Scale (Triandis, & Gelfland, 1998) is a 16-question item scale that focuses on the vertical and horizontal aspects of individualistic and collectivistic cultures. Vertical collectivism is seeing yourself as one in a group and being accepting of inequalities and hierarchies, horizontal collectivism is when you perceive all group members as equals, vertical individualism is when we see ourselves as our main source of power, but acknowledge and accept differences between individuals, and lastly, horizontal individualism is when we believe that everyone is equal and everyone should ideally be the same amount as equal. When answering these 16 questions, participants will write their answers on a 9-point Likert scale. Choices of answer range from 1 (Never) to 9 (always). This was found to be satisfactory as it was used in a previous validated study as this was their reasoning for its reliability and validity. (Anakwah et al., 2020).
Crime Reenactment Video: Appendix D
The video that will be shown to the participants will be sourced from Irwanda et al, (2022) that was focusing on misinformation and false memories in adolescents and adults. This 47-second-long video depicts a man kidnapping two children. The validity of this video serving as an effective piece for this study can be found in a study that was conducted that was focusing on misinformation and memory recall in adolescents and adults (Irwanda et al. 2022).
Culturally Specific Questions about video Prior to Week break: Appendix E
The questions in this study will be inspired by Anakwah et al, (2020) study about Cross Cultural differences in Eyewitness Memory Reports. It’s been a challenge finding all of the original questions in that but I have found a few that I’m going to use as a base for my 5 questions. Since this is a draft, I currently don’t have all 5 five questions for both groups done as I’ve been balancing a lot on my plate recently.I will also have to find a way to check the validity so I will still be searching for the questions that Anakwah et al, (2020) used.
Culturally specific Script read by judge: Appendix F
This will be a script that will be read out by the judge when the participants return after their week-long break. This script will be a retelling of the video the participants watched a week prior, but certain information will be purposely incorrect. The misinformation in this script will relate to some of the questions that the participants answered. Since there are two groups that means there are 10 questions in total, I was thinking of putting 3 questions from each group into the script so it's an even distribution. I still have to write the script as it was a last-minute idea on how to fix not having to alter the video. With writing the script, I will try to find a way to validate it through writing centers on campus or online.

Design:
My design will consist of a 2 (culture) x 2 (memory) x 2 (Stimulus type) x 2 (instructions) mixed design. Culture will operate between two independent levels, the two levels [HS1] of culture are individualistic versus collectivistic and will be independent groups [HS2] For my presentation of culturally specific eyewitness [HS3] question information, it will also revolve around two independent levels. These two levels are truthful information versus purposeful misinformation a[HS4] bout the event. The stimulus type which is the crime video that the participants will view is a within group as all participants in the study will be viewing the vide[HS5] o and then retold the story by the judge. With this, each of the participants will engage in the same steps in this study all the way until [HS6] the end, making the instructions another [HS7] within group. Our independent variable in this study are the questions and presentation of misinformation that we’ll be showing participants as they’ll be manipulated by us, while the dependent variable is the recall ability rate with affect of purposeful misinformation.
Procedure:
Arrival 
In order to collect my data for my research, I will be in a psychology lab with two large rooms that are designed to look exactly like a courtroom. One of these rooms will house individuality cultures while the other collectivist. There will be a mock judge, audience, security, and other courtroom individuals to help make the participants feel more immersed in the experience as we’d want authentic answers. During the pre-misinformation stage we plan to collect our data on a Saturday at 11am till 2pm since most people have off on the weekends and hopefully many won’t have any morning plans. It’s also been shown that Cognitive functioning works the best at around 11-12pm (Evans et al., 2017).
When the participants arrive, they’ll be greeted and led to a private room where they’ll engage in answering 5 questionnaires before they perform in the actual study. When they enter the room, they’ll sit in the chair that is next to table with 3 sheets of paper on it. These sheets of paper consist of two questionnaires and a consent form. The participants will engage in the consent sheet (Appendix A). If the participant doesn’t feel comfortable doing the study anymore they can ask to leave the room and we will direct them out. After participants finish this sheet, they can just set it to side of the table they’re working on as they’ll next complete the Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire (MMQ) (Troyer & Rich, 2018) (Appendix B). The materials used in this will just be sheets of paper with the questions on it and pencil. The reason the participants will engage in the MMQ is so we test to see where the recall ability and rate is prior to testing. When the participants finish working on the multifactorial memory questionnaire they will engage next in the culture orientation scale (Appendix C) (Triandis, & Gelfland, 1998). After completing this and placing all papers to the side of the table, the participants can leave the room and wait in the hallway to indicate that they’re finished.
While participants are waiting, we’ll quickly have our statistical assistant tally up their scores while not showing them to us in order to determine where they land on the individualistic and collectivistic culture spectrum. When the results for that are finally finished, we’ll begin placing participants into their respective courtrooms. When participants enter into the courtroom, they’ll be directed to sit in the eyewitness seats. When participants reach their seats, one of the courtroom helpers will roll out a TV that will display a reenactment of a crime video (Appendix D). After viewing the video, each of the participants will be handed a sheet of paper that holds 5 questions that focuses on culturally specific questions about the vide[HS16] o (appendix E) that each of the participants will answer as this is our dependent variable. The questions will focus on the central (Ex. What color was the man shirt?) and background elements (Ex. What time of day was it?) in the video. For individualistic groups, there will be a heavier focus on central items while for collectivist there will be a heavier focus on background item questions. This split is due to how those in individualistic cultures have tend to have their attention on more central details (color of man shirt or hair) while those in collectivist cultures like to look at more bigger picture items (time of day or weather at the time) (Jiao & Zhao,. 2023). When the participants are handed the sheet, the judge will read over the questions aloud. When participants are finished they will be directed out of the courtroom. 
There will be a week-long break so the information in the participants' heads can settle. When the participants return after the break, they will be directed into their culturally specific same room with the same judge they had as before. The judge will greet them and will give a quick reminder to both culture groups about the video they witnessed last week. During this reminder however, the judge will alter the video story with small amounts of misinformation (Appendix F) when retelling the story to certain randomized culture groups. After being informed and reminded about the video, the participants will be handed their question sheet again but this time, the judge will say that the participants have the ability to change their answers if they feel like they answered wrong previously. The participants will be given 15 minutes to think about their responses and make changes if needed. After these 15 minutes, the participants will be directed to exit the courtroom.
Debriefing:
After our study, we will inform participants of the study they were just a part of and its purpose. We’ll also mention that if they don’t want us to use their data, they can email us to have it removed. We’ll tell participants that if they’re interested in the results of study overall, they can expect to see them on our website or can contact us for a hardcopy since it’ll be open access. After that, we’ll send our participants on their way home.
 
Measures and Materials:
Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire: Appendix B
The MMQ (Troyer & Rich, 2018) is a 3-level questionnaire that focuses on an individual’s memory satisfaction, strategy, and ability. Within each of these 3 levels, each level has a series of 18-20 questions that participants must answer regarding those 3 levels. The satisfaction level, consisting of 18 questions focusing on overall satisfaction of their memory while also asking about concerns. Participants can score between 0-72 in this level.  In the strategy level, it consists of 19 questions asking about how practical they are in daily decision making. Participants can score between 0-76 this level. The ability level consists of 20 common memory mistakes that participants are asked if they do, they can score between 0-80. This questionnaire has proper validity because it was operated and validated as a proper measurement in a previous study (Fiorella et al., 2021). We are using the test pre and post eyewitness study to test our participants memory recall ability and rate.
Culture Orientation Scale: Appendix C
The Culture Orientation Scale (Triandis, & Gelfland, 1998) is a 16-question item scale that focuses on the vertical and horizontal aspects of individualistic and collectivistic cultures. Vertical collectivism is seeing yourself as one in a group and being accepting of inequalities and hierarchies, horizontal collectivism is when you perceive all group members as equals, vertical individualism is when we see ourselves as our main source of power, but acknowledge and accept differences between individuals, and lastly, horizontal individualism is when we believe that everyone is equal and everyone should ideally be the same amount as equal. When answering these 16 questions, participants will write their answers on a 9-point Likert scale. Choices of answer range from 1 (Never) to 9 (always). This was found to be satisfactory as it was used in a previous validated study as this was their reasoning for its reliability and validity. (Anakwah et al., 2020).
Crime Reenactment Video: Appendix D
The video that will be shown to the participants will be sourced from Irwanda et al, (2022) that was focusing on misinformation and false memories in adolescents and adults. This 47-second-long video depicts a man kidnapping two children. The validity of this video serving as an effective piece for this study can be found in a study that was conducted that was focusing on misinformation and memory recall in adolescents and adults (Irwanda et al. 2022).
Culturally Specific Questions about video Prior to Week break: Appendix E
The questions in this study will be inspired by Anakwah et al, (2020) study about Cross Cultural differences in Eyewitness Memory Reports. It’s been a challenge finding all of the original questions in that but I have found a few that I’m going to use as a base for my 5 questions. Since this is a draft, I currently don’t have all 5 five questions for both groups done as I’ve been balancing a lot on my plate recently.I will also have to find a way to check the validity so I will still be searching for the questions that Anakwah et al, (2020) used.
Culturally specific Script read by judge: Appendix F
This will be a script that will be read out by the judge when the participants return after their week-long break. This script will be a retelling of the video the participants watched a week prior, but certain information will be purposely incorrect. The misinformation in this script will relate to some of the questions that the participants answered. Since there are two groups that means there are 10 questions in total, I was thinking of putting 3 questions from each group into the script so it's an even distribution. I still have to write the script as it was a last-minute idea on how to fix not having to alter the video. With writing the script, I will try to find a way to validate it through writing centers on campus or online.
