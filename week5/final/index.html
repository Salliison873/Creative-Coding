        My intention of making this project was to have a website in which you could interact with randomly generated stories. My original intentions were to write poems dedicated to the NBA Team the Boston Celtics as they are my favorite basketball team and they just recently won the 2024 NBA World Championship title. When I gave it some more thought however, I thought that I would just really be limiting myself instead of being creative. I thought about going back and recreating the drawing projects we did our first week in code, but I didn’t have time like my friend when planning it out. Because of this, I went back to my idea of randomly generating stories. I originally wanted to have a series of different changing words for each story, but I had a lot of trouble trying to figure it out when coding it. As mentioned, time was not on my side so I didn’t have a proper chance to sit down and figure it out. To make up for this, I used the remix websites that we did for our remix assignment and messed around heavily with the code. Along with that I also gave each site their own name and unique designs.

What inspired me to do these  stories was a previous project I had done in another digital class. For this project, I made a choose your own adventure game website in which you got to play as Batman or go on a bike ride. For this project, I tried to recreate that website by having the main webpage be the sorta choose your own adventure story, with links to 3 other stories. What inspired me to make these 3 little stories were simply things I like. Which are fantasy, sci-fi, and James Bond. I would also say that a lot of music helped inspire these stories, especially the potion one. Believe it or not, I got most of my medieval words that I used from a lot of hip-hop songs(mainly MF DOOM, A Tribe Called Quest, and Wu Tang Clan)

My stories don’t have any life changing or important themes. They are just made to have fun with and read once and while. I love to write, but I mainly write scientific papers as I am in the field of STEM unfortunately. I never have the chance to really creatively write, so whenever I get the chance to I always try my best to not only make it fun for myself, but for others as well. The only thing I hope these stories can achieve is giving someone a moment of laughter, peace, or relaxation. I also hope that these stories can inspire others to make their stories. I also hope it could inspire to get into other things like coding, art, and just simply making something
