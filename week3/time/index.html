    <h1 style="font-family: cursive; position: relative; right: -800px; bottom: -90px">The <em style="color:darkpurple">Funky</em> Hotel</h1>

    <p style="display: none;"> What The Funky Hotel sets out to achieve is an enjoyable and hopefully simple way to tell time. I got the inspiration for this by going outside and looking at my apartment complex at night. I love looking at buildings at night because it's fun to count how many windows are lit up, and thats what I tried to do in this project. Each time you come back to it, the windows will change time and it'll be a sweet surpirse when you rememeber it's a clock. 

    When doing this project, I tried to stay away from doing the things we were told to avoid, but I think I unfortunately did a progress bar. I tried to keep the hotel vauge despite this, as I orginially put what rooms there were to tell what time it was. One thing this project helped me accomplish and understand really well were the push() and pop() features. As well as the map() function, I'm still a bit confused on it, but I understood it for this project and was able to accomplish it. </p>
