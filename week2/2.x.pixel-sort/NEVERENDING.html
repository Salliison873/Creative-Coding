    <!-- About: For my house of dust project I made a parody of the poem you could say. I really enjoy interactive stories that generate random numbers or letters as you read them or refresh them, and thats what I decided to do with this project. I decided to make a "casino" as I wanted to use more than words for this project as I have an emoji keyboard so I wanted to test that out. I got all my inspiration for my names, citys, and overall idea from listening to music, but mainly Tom Waits. I also wanted to make a random number generator game which basically takes the form of black jack.
