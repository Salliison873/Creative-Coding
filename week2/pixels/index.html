        the reason why this exsist is because I am a huge fan of green lantern. Since this picture has a lot of color in it, I was also interested to see how it would look broken up and pixelated. To help make the colors pop out, I added a stroke and frame rate to have colors fade in the lines of the squares. The only problem I had with this is that it fades more cool colors (blue/green) than the entirety of the color spectrum.
